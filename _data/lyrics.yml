- song: Hail The Day That Sees Him Rise
  artist: Charles Wesley
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Hail the day that sees Him rise
    To His throne above the skies
    Christ, awhile to mortals given
    Reascends His native heaven

    There the glorious triumph waits
    Lift your heads, eternal gates
    Christ hath conquered death and sin
    Take the King of glory in

    Circled round with angel powers
    Their triumphant Lord, and ours
    Conqueror over death and sin
    Take the King of glory in

    Him though highest Heav’n receives
    Still He loves the earth He leaves
    Though returning to His throne
    Still He calls mankind His own

    Circled round with angel powers
    Their triumphant Lord, and ours
    Conqueror over death and sin
    Take the King of glory in

    See! He lifts His hands above
    See! He shows the prints of love
    Hark! His gracious lips bestow
    Blessings on His church below

    Alleluia
    Alleluia
    Alleluia

    Ever upward let us move
    Wafted on the wings of love
    Looking when our Lord shall come
    Longing, gasping after home

    There we shall with Thee remain
    Partners of Thy endless reign
    There Thy face unclouded see
    Find our heaven of heavens in Thee
- song: Closer Walk With Thee
  artist: ''

  lyrics: |-
    I am weak, but Thou art strong;
    Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
    I’ll be satisfied as long
    As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.

    Refrain:
    Just a closer walk with Thee,
    Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
    Daily walking close to Thee,
    Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

    In this life of toil and snares,
    If I falter, Lord, who cares?
    Who with me my burden shares?
    None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

    When my feeble life is o’er,
    Time for me will be no more;
    Guide me gently, safely o’er
    To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.

  lyrics: |-
    Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
    Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
    Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
    Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

    Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
    I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
    Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
    Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

    Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
    Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
    Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
    High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

    High King of Heaven, my victory won,
    May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!
    Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
    Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

  lyrics: |-
    Trials, troubles, tribulations,
    Soon from all of these to soar
    When our Savior comes to get us,
    Peace shall reign forever more

    (Refrain)
    When our Lord comes down from Heaven
    and stretches out His hand to me
    I’ll be carried home by Jesus
    There forever with Him be

    The promised grace will come upon you,
    All the earth shall be restored
    The sky and sea and every mountain,
    Glory as not known before

    The sun and moon depart the sky,
    We’ve no need for them to stay
    The Lamb of God will be our light,
    Brighter than the brightest day
- song: Rock of Ages
  artist: Augustus M. Toplady
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From Thy wounded side which flowed,
    Be of sin the double cure;
    Save from wrath and make me pure.

    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to the cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress;
    Helpless look to Thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    And behold Thee on Thy throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee.

    What can wash away my sin?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    What can make me whole again?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Oh! precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow;
    No other fount I know,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    For my pardon, this I see,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    For my cleansing this my plea,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Nothing can for sin atone,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    Naught of good that I have done,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    This is all my hope and peace,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    This is all my righteousness,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    (Additional Verses)

    Now by this I’ll overcome—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
    Now by this I’ll reach my home—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Glory! Glory! This I sing—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
    All my praise for this I bring—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
- song: It Is Well With My Soul
  artist: Horatio G. Spafford
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
    When sorrows like sea billows roll;
    Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
    It is well, it is well, with my soul.

    Refrain

    It is well, with my soul,
    It is well, with my soul,
    It is well, it is well, with my soul.

    Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
    Let this blest assurance control,
    That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
    And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

    Refrain

    My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
    My sin, not in part but the whole,
    Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

    Refrain

    And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
    The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
    Even so, it is well with my soul.

    (Additional Verses)

    For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
    If Jordan above me shall roll,
    No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
    Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

    But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
    The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
    Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
    Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!

- song: Come Thou Fount
  artist: Chris Tomlin
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above
