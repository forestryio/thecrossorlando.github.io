    Tangled in lies

    And You take brokenness aside
    And make it beautiful

    Will You call me child

    'Cause all I know
    Is how to cry

    Out of the depths I cry to my Lord, he lifted me up, he lifted me up

    Who could stand up, Lord, who could stand up?
    If you kept a record of sins who could stand, my Lord
    Who could stand up, Lord, who could stand up?

    With you, oh Lord, there is forgiveness
    With you, oh Lord, unfailing love
    With you, oh Lord, full redemption
    You have bought back my soul from the dead with your blood

    So my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait
    More than watchman who wait for the morning sun
    So my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait
    More than watchman who wait for the morn

    [Verse 1]
    Grace, what have You done?
    Murdered for me on that cross
    Accused in absence of wrong
    My sin washed away in Your blood

    [Pre-Chorus 1]
    Too much to make sense of it all
    I know that Your love breaks my fall
    The scandal of grace, You died in my place
    So my soul will live

    Forever the hope in my heart

    Your power is as dead as my sin
    The cross has taught me to live
    And mercy, my heart now to sing

    The day and its trouble shall come
    I know that Your strength is enough
    The scandal of grace, You died in my place
