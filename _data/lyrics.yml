- song: Come Thou Fount
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above

- song: This is My Father's World
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    This is My Father's World
    This is my father's world
    And to my listening ears
    All nature sings, and round me rings
    The music of the spheres
    
    This is my father's world
    I rest me in the thought
    Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
    His hand the wonders wrought
    
    This is my father's world
    Dreaming, I see His face
    Open my eyes, and in glad surprise
    Cry "The Lord is in this place"
    
    This is my father's world
    From the shining courts above
    The beloved One, His only Son
    Came a pledge of deathless love
    
    This is my Father’s world
    Oh, let me ne’er forget
    That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
    God is the ruler yet.
    This is my Father’s world,
    The battle is not done
    Jesus who died shall be satisfied,
    And earth and Heav’n be one.

- song: Christ Be All Around Me
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    As I rise, strength of God
    Go before, lift me up
    As I wake, eyes of God
    Look upon, be my sight

    As I wait, heart of God
    Satisfy and sustain
    As I hear, voice of God
    Lead me on, and be my guide
    And be my guide

    Above and below me
    Before and behind me
    In every eye that sees me
    Christ be all around me
    Above and below me
    Before and behind me
    In every eye that sees me
    Christ be all around me
    Whoa...Whoa...Christ be all around me

    As I go, hand of God
    My defense, by my side
    As I rest, breath of God
    Fall upon, bring me peace
    Bring me peace

    Your life, Your death
    Your blood was shed
    For every moment
    Every moment

- song: Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    Amazing grace
    How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost, but now I'm found
    Was blind, but now I see

    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
    And grace my fears relieved
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed

    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The Lord has promised good to me
    His word my hope secures
    He will my shield and portion be
    As long as life endures

    [2x]
    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
    The sun forbear to shine
    But God, Who called me here below,
    Will be forever mine.
    Will be forever mine.
    You are forever mine.
  artist: Chris Tomlin
