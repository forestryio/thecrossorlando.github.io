- song: Trials and Troubles No More
  artist: Tribulations, Estil C. Ball
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Trials, troubles, tribulations,
    Soon from all of these to soar
    When our Savior comes to get us,
    Peace shall reign forever more

    (Refrain)
    When our Lord comes down from Heaven
    and stretches out His hand to me
    I’ll be carried home by Jesus
    There forever with Him be

    The promised grace will come upon you,
    All the earth shall be restored
    The sky and sea and every mountain,
    Glory as not known before

    The sun and moon depart the sky,
    We’ve no need for them to stay
    The Lamb of God will be our light,
    Brighter than the brightest day
- song: Rock of Ages
  artist: Augustus M. Toplady
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee;
    Let the water and the blood,
    From Thy wounded side which flowed,
    Be of sin the double cure;
    Save from wrath and make me pure.

    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to the cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress;
    Helpless look to Thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
    And behold Thee on Thy throne,
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee.
- song: Nothing But The Blood
  artist: Robert Lowry
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    What can wash away my sin?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    What can make me whole again?
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Oh! precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow;
    No other fount I know,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    For my pardon, this I see,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    For my cleansing this my plea,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Nothing can for sin atone,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    Naught of good that I have done,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    This is all my hope and peace,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
    This is all my righteousness,
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    (Additional Verses)

    Now by this I’ll overcome—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
    Now by this I’ll reach my home—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

    Refrain

    Glory! Glory! This I sing—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
    All my praise for this I bring—
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
- song: It Is Well With My Soul
  artist: Horatio G. Spafford
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
    When sorrows like sea billows roll;
    Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
    It is well, it is well, with my soul.

    Refrain

    It is well, with my soul,
    It is well, with my soul,
    It is well, it is well, with my soul.

    Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
    Let this blest assurance control,
    That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
    And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

    Refrain

    My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
    My sin, not in part but the whole,
    Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

    Refrain

    And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
    The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
    Even so, it is well with my soul.

    (Additional Verses)

    For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
    If Jordan above me shall roll,
    No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
    Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

    But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
    The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
    Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
    Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!

    Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
    Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
    Jesus ready stands to save you,
    Full of pity, love and power.

    Refrain

    I will arise and go to Jesus,
    He will embrace me in His arms;
    In the arms of my dear Savior,
    O there are ten thousand charms.

    Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,
    God’s free bounty glorify;
    True belief and true repentance,
    Every grace that brings you nigh.

    Refrain

    Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
    Lost and ruined by the fall;
    If you tarry till you’re better,
    You will never come at all.

  artist: Rebecca St James
  lyrics: |-
    Out of the depths of my despair
    Oh I cry Father hear my voice
    Open Your ears to hear my mercy cry

    And if You kept a book of sin
    Oh Father, who'd be standing?
    But in Your goodness there is mercy & forgiveness

    More than the watchmen wait for morning
    My soul it waits for You
    More than the watchmen wait for morning

    More than the watchmen wait for morning
    My soul it waits for You
    More than the watchmen wait for morning

    Out of the depths of my despair
    Oh I cry Father hear my voice
    Open Your ears to hear my mercy cry

    And if You kept a book of sin
    Oh Father, who'd be standing?
    But in Your goodness there is mercy & forgiveness

    I don't wanna ride on somebody else's passion.
    I don't wanna find that I am just dry bones.
    I wanna burn with unquenchable fire.

- song: Come Thou Fount
  artist: Chris Tomlin
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above
