- song: We Are Blessed
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    We are loved at the end of our rope
    When we're less there is more of the Lord
    In the fight for our souls we must learn to let go
    And abandon who we are

    We are loved when we feel all is lost
    When the shadows are cast on the cross
    Only then can we know the embrace of the one
    Who's carried us along

    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed

    We are loved when we feel most content
    With who we are, nothing more nothing less
    We'll inherit the earth declaring Your worth
    Bring glory to Your name

    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed
    We are blessed, we are blessed

    We're blessed, we're loved
    Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice
    We're blessed, we're loved
    Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice

- song: Our God Alone
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    Who formed the mountains and filled the oceans?
    Our god alone, our god alone
    Who took the dust, breathed life in us?
    Our god alone, our god alone

    Alleluia

    Who came from heaven for our redemption?
    Our god alone, our god alone
    Who died for sin that we may live?
    Our god alone, our god alone

    Alleluia

    Who rose again? death could not win
    Our god alone, our god alone
    Who is returning bringing our kingdom?
    Our god alone, our god alone

    We will worship, we will worship
    Our god alone, our god alone
    We will worship, we will worship
    Our god alone, our god alone

    Alleluia

- song: Good Good Father
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
    But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night
    And you tell me that you're pleased
    And that I'm never alone

    You're a good good father
    It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
    And I'm loved by you
    It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

    I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
    But I know we're all searching
    For answers only you provide
    'Cause you know just what we need
    Before we say a word

    You're a good good father
    It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
    And I'm loved by you
    It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

    Because you are perfect in all of your ways
    You are perfect in all of your ways
    You are perfect in all of your ways to us

    You are…

- song: Your Love Is Strong
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    Heavenly Father 
    You always amaze me
    Let Your kingdom come in my world 
    And in my life

    Give me the food I need to live through today
    And forgive me as I forgive the people that wrong me

    Lead me far from temptation
    Deliver me from the evil one

    I look out the window
    The birds are composing
    Not a note is out of tune
    Or out of place

    I walk to the meadow
    And stare at the flowers
    Better dressed than any girl
    On her wedding day

    So why should I worry?
    Why do I freak out?
    God knows what I need!
    You know what I need!

    Your love is strong

    The Kingdom of the Heavens 
    Is now advancing
    Invade my heart
    Invade this broken town

    The Kingdom of the Heavens 
    Is buried treasure
    Would you sell yourself
    To buy the one you've found?

    Two things You told me
    That You are strong
    And You love me,
    Yes You love me

    Your love is strong

    Our God in heaven
    Hallowed be thy name above all names
    Your kingdom come
    Your will be done
    On earth as it is in heaven
    Give us, today, our daily bread
    Forgive us weary sinners
    Keep us far from our vices and
    Deliver us from these prisons

- song: Come Thou Fount
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above

- song: This is My Father's World
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    This is My Father's World
    This is my father's world
    And to my listening ears
    All nature sings, and round me rings
    The music of the spheres
    
    This is my father's world
    I rest me in the thought
    Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
    His hand the wonders wrought
    
    This is my father's world
    Dreaming, I see His face
    Open my eyes, and in glad surprise
    Cry "The Lord is in this place"
    
    This is my father's world
    From the shining courts above
    The beloved One, His only Son
    Came a pledge of deathless love
    
    This is my Father’s world
    Oh, let me ne’er forget
    That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
    God is the ruler yet.
    This is my Father’s world,
    The battle is not done
    Jesus who died shall be satisfied,
    And earth and Heav’n be one.

    As I rise, strength of God
    Go before, lift me up
    As I wake, eyes of God
    Look upon, be my sight

    Your blood was shed
    For every moment
    Every moment

- song: Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |-
    Amazing grace
    How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost, but now I'm found
    Was blind, but now I see

    'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
    And grace my fears relieved
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed

    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The Lord has promised good to me
    His word my hope secures
    He will my shield and portion be
    As long as life endures

    [2x]
    My chains are gone
    I've been set free
    My God, my Savior has ransomed me
    And like a flood His mercy reigns
    Unending love, amazing grace

    The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
    The sun forbear to shine
    But God, Who called me here below,
    Will be forever mine.
    Will be forever mine.
    You are forever mine.
