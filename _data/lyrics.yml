- song: More Than The Watchman (Psalm 130)
  artist: Rebecca St James
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |-
    Out of the depths of my despair
    Oh I cry Father hear my voice
    Open Your ears to hear my mercy cry

    And if You kept a book of sin
    Oh Father, who'd be standing?
    But in Your goodness there is mercy & forgiveness

    CHORUS:
    More than the watchmen wait for morning
    My soul it waits for You
    More than the watchmen wait for morning

    More than the watchmen wait for morning
    My soul it waits for You
    More than the watchmen wait for morning

    Out of the depths of my despair
    Oh I cry Father hear my voice
    Open Your ears to hear my mercy cry

    And if You kept a book of sin
    Oh Father, who'd be standing?
    But in Your goodness there is mercy & forgiveness

- song: Help Me Find My Own Flame
  artist: Will Reagan & United Pursuit
  enabled: true
  lyrics: |
    I don't wanna ride on somebody else's passion.
    I don't wanna find that I am just dry bones.
    I wanna burn with unquenchable fire.
    Deep down inside see it coming alive

    Help me find my own flame.
    Help me find my own fire.
    I want the real thing,
    I want your burning desire

    I don't wanna ride on somebody else's passion.
    I don't wanna find that I am just dry bones.
    I wanna burn with unquenchable fire.
    Deep down inside see it coming alive
    Help me find my own flame.
    Help me find my own fire.
    I want the real thing,
    I want your burning desire

    Do what only you can do, in my heart tonight
    There's no better time
    Help me find my own flame.
    Help me find my own fire.
    I want the real thing,
    I want your burning desire
    I don't wanna ride on somebody else's passion.
    I don't wanna find that I am just dry bones.
    I wanna burn with unquenchable fire.
    Deep down inside see it coming alive
    I wanna burn with unquenchable fire.
    Deep down inside see it coming alive
    Help me find my own flame.
    Help me find my own fire.
    I want the real thing,
    I want your burning desire
    Do what only you can do, in my heart tonight
    There's no better time
- song: Come Thou Fount
  artist: Chris Tomlin
  enabled: false
  lyrics: |
    Come thou fount of every blessing
    Tune my heart to sing thy grace
    Streams of mercy never ceasing
    Call for songs of loudest praise
    Teach me some melodious sonnet
    Sung by flaming tongues above
    I'll praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
    Mount of thy redeeming love

    Here I raise my Ebenezer
    Hither by thy help I come
    And I hope by thy good pleasure
    Safely to arrive at home

    Jesus sought me when a stranger
    Wondering from the fold of God
    He, to rescue me from danger
    Interposed His precious blood

    O to grace how great a debtor daily
    I'm constrained to be!
    Let thy goodness like a fetter,
    bind my wandering heart to thee
    Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
    prone to leave the God I love
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    seal it for thy courts above
