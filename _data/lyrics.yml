    him, \nfor he is your health and salvation!\nLet all who hear\nNow to his temple
    draw near,\nJoining in glad adoration!\n\nPraise to the Lord, who over all \nThings
    is wondrously reigning \nAnd, as on wings of an eagle, \nuplifting, sustaining.\nHave
    you not seen\nAll that is needful has been\nSent by his gracious ordaining?\n\nPraise
    to the Lord, who will \nProsper your work and defend you;\nSurely his goodness
    and mercy\nShall daily attend you.\nPonder anew\nWhat the almighty can do\nAs
    with his love he befriends you.\n\nPraise to the Lord! Oh, let all\nThat is in
    me adore him!\nAll that has life and breath, \nCome now with praises before him!\nLet
    the amen\nSound from his people again.\nGladly forever adore him!"

    1. My hope is built on nothing less
    Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
    I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
    But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    2. When darkness veils His lovely face,
    I rest on His unchanging grace;
    In every high and stormy gale
    My anchor holds within the veil.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    3. His oath, His covenant, and blood
    Support me in the whelming flood;
    When every earthly prop gives way,
    He then is all my Hope and Stay.
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    4. When He shall come with trumpet sound,
    Oh, may I then in Him be found,
    Clothed in His righteousness alone,
    Faultless to stand before the throne!
    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    All other ground is sinking sand.

    1. Take my life and let it be
    Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
    Take my moments and my days,
    Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

    2. Take my hands and let them move
    At the impulse of Thy love;
    Take my feet and let them be
    Swift and beautiful for Thee.

    3. Take my voice and let me sing
    Always, only, for my King;
    Take my lips and let them be
    Filled with messages from Thee.

    4. Take my silver and my gold,
    Not a mite would I withhold;
    Take my intellect and use
    Every power as Thou shalt choose.

    5. Take my will and make it Thine,
    It shall be no longer mine;
    Take my heart, it is Thine own,
    It shall be Thy royal throne.

    6. Take my love, my Lord, I pour

    And You take brokenness aside

    Will You call me child

    'Cause all I know

    If it's not one thing it's another

    God is my shepherd
    I won't be wanting
    I won't be wanting
    He makes me rest
    In fields of green
    With quiet streams

    Even though I walk
    Through the valley
    Of death and dying
    I will not fear
    Cause you are with me
    You are with me

    Your shepherd's staff comforts me
    You are my feast
    In the presence of enemies
    Surely goodness will follow me
    Follow me
    In the house of God forever

    God is my shepherd
    I won't be wanting
    I won't be wanting
    He makes me rest
    In fields of green
    By quiet streams

    Even while I'm walking
    Through the valley
    Of death and dying
    I will not fear
    Cause you are with me
    You're always with me

    Your shepherd's staff comforts me
    You are my feast

    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

    Save from wrath and make me pure.

    Not the labor of my hands
    Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;
    Could my zeal no respite know,
    Could my tears forever flow,
    All for sin could not atone;
    Thou must save, and Thou alone.

    Nothing in my hand I bring,
    Simply to the cross I cling;
    Naked, come to Thee for dress;
    Helpless look to Thee for grace;
    Foul, I to the fountain fly;
    Wash me, Savior, or I die.

    While I draw this fleeting breath,
    When mine eyes shall close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown,
