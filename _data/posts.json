During her high school career, she was a competitive swimmer, which helped her get through school because she admits, “I struggled with my grades. I struggled with paying attention and staying in school.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moon later moved to Gainesville and attended the University of Florida where she also met her husband, who was on a visit from England — “We met on the dance floor at an underground rave. I was one of those kids!” she claims.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>As it went, she was not ready for college and moved to England for 10 months. Moon and Huggett married and the couple had their first baby within two years. After a total of five years off, she did graduate from UCF in interpersonal communications “because I clearly needed to learn how to communicate,” Moon-Huggett said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moving right into sales, she spent 13 years hitting the pavement, knocking on doors, selling medical devices, pharmaceuticals and payroll services. Each one of these jobs led her to where she is today.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It all started by watching the “Food, Inc.” documentary, followed by countless other documentaries, and very soon Moon-Huggett was the attentive student!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>People like Kris Carr and David Avocado Wolfe inspired her to learn about juicing. “I was in love with the entire process from start to finish. I loved shopping for local, organic produce, washing it, juicing and drinking out of our fancy wine glasses. How could I make this a living?”</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">From Dream to Reality</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Knee jerk reaction: she quit her sales job and set up her first tent and table and prayed someone would come over to try the juices she’d prepared. New Smyrna Farmers Market was where New Moon began in June of 2014. She spent 12-14 hours in the kitchen juicing and learning. She even stood outside a building on Orange Ave., downtown Orlando, sampling concoctions [where this writer first learned of New Moon juice].</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, New Moon Market found its first location in the College Park area of Orlando. “You know when you know. It’s meant to be when every door opens and all the right people show up in your life.<br />\nOf course, any foodpreneur will tell you the buildout took longer, the costs of required permits needed was overwhelming. We were fortunate to get the loan from my father, Tim Moon, and will be juicing for the rest of my life to pay him back,” Moon-Huggett said jokingly. “It takes a lot of capital to start a business right!<br />\nWe would not have been able to do this on our own — a reality many foodpreneurs struggle with. Capital is key!”</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Starting Small</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-9392 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1704.New-Moon-Market-8167-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1704.New-Moon-Market-8167-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1704.New-Moon-Market-8167-210x140.jpg 210w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1704.New-Moon-Market-8167-272x182.jpg 272w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1704.New-Moon-Market-8167.jpg 600w\" alt=\"New Moon Market - Orlando, Florida\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Moon-Huggett worked farmers markets for </span>two years testing products before opening her location and recommends this to anyone getting started in food or juice. “It is the perfect platform for people to get to know you and your products. I went to local yoga studios and sold juice from the trunk of my car and drove all over town to deliver. When we opened, we knew our juices worked and then we started building our food menu. We make everything in house and our products have a short shelf life, which is why we make smaller batches to guarantee the freshest juice. We juice every day,” Moon-Huggett shared.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moon-Huggett describes herself as “over the <em>Moon</em> grateful to my parents who believed in me and helped get this dream off the ground and into reality.” She also thanks her husband and children for their generous support throughout the process.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Her children are seeing firsthand the long hours of hard work and dedication that it takes to open a business. You can even find her kids sitting at the juice bar doing homework, <span class=\"s1\">drinking their favorite Smoothie – Cheeky Monkey! </span>In addition to her own family, Moon-Huggett has a love for the staff she employs at New Moon Market and they continue to “open our minds up to the New Age way of thinking.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Any business owner will tell you it’s the customers they are most thankful for; we call them friends. This is a gift and I am grateful to be of service to our community and to offer access to a healthy way of living.” #eatwelllivewell</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>* New Moon Market has surpassed its goals by quite a bit in its first year and will expand to locations number two and three in fiscal 2017.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>www.NewMoonMarket.com</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>2314 Edgewater Drive  | </b><b>Orlando, FL 32804 | </b><b>407.440.8147</b></p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://getwelli.com\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8207 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kristine-Thomas-e1469122837929-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kristine-Thomas-e1469122837929-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kristine-Thomas-e1469122837929-120x120.jpg 120w\" alt=\"Kristine Thomas - Food leader in Orlando and Central Florida\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Kristine Thomas is the Executive Director of the ORL Food Lab.

Many of these barriers stem from concentrated poverty, but there are additional barriers, both physical and metaphoric, that manifest in a variety of ways.

As a student at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, he became a disability rights activist, and led a movement to create curb cuts, or ramps, to allow sidewalk access to people with wheelchairs.

It is that a much larger and unanticipated group of people also benefitted from the well-designed solution of curb cuts. Anyone pushing a baby stroller or a grocery cart, riding a skateboard or bicycle, can use a curb cut. Curb cuts help call attention to an intersection’s crosswalk which increases pedestrian safety, are easier to shovel clear in the snow, and are more navigable for the very young and old. When people concentrate their efforts in assisting the overlooked, and solving just a single problem, it can open a whole new world of opportunities for all of society.

He went into death to bring you life. He will also go into your money to rescue provision and care. He will go into your pain and cruelty to rescue contentment and kindness. So that life is full of open ended possibility.</p>\n<p>The church, at it&#8217;s best, is people living out of that reality. All the hard questions are answered, the failures are repaired, the future is secured. The church, at it&#8217;s best, is a little colony of people presenting reality to their neighbors and inviting them to join in. I&#8217;m hoping this Easter season I can remember what&#8217;s real and be a living embodiment of reality to the folks around me.</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/1003/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/1003/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=15184355&#038;post=1003&#038;subd=tcandk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />"

    "title": "Stanley Needs a Job",
    "description": "<p>I know a guy named Stanley who needs a job. He&#8217;s in his forties and does not have a great resume or work ethic. He has some health problems. He seems to get hurt on the job a lot and has tried to sue more than one employer. He quit high school in the 10th grade but eventually earned a GED and joined the military. He characterizes his time in the military as the best time in his life. Since then, he has been out of work just as often as he has been employed. </p>\n<p>Stanley has tried out some job training programs but none have helped him get or keep a job. “There are just certain types of people we are not equipped to help,” said the director of one such program. I was a little surprised to hear him say that since I knew the program was started some years ago to help people exactly like Stanley. The director went on to explain how his organization had made a conscious decision to focus on people with fewer issues than Stanley seemed to have before adding, “and we have been expanding rapidly ever since.”</p>\n<p>I have heard explanations like this before. A non-profit starts out trying to reach the most hurting and marginalized in our midst but as the frustrations of dealing with the harder cases collide with the desire to grow the organization, they raise the bar on who they are willing to help. In some ways, it makes sense. Why spend 90% of your effort to help 50% of your clients achieve 10% of the desired outcomes? Focus on those who are ready and equipped to move forward and you will see the fruit of your hard work pay off more quickly while watching your programs grow and funding increase. Seems like a rational choice.</p>\n<p>But what about Stanley?</p>\n<p>There is a big difference between helping people get a job and helping a particular person get a job. When you help people get a job, you weed out the Stanleys until you find someone easier to work with. But when you try to help Stanley get a job, everything changes because he continues to matter to you whether he gets a job or not. If Stanley is more to you than a client – if he’s a friend, a family member, or a neighbor – you continue to invite him to social gatherings while he’s looking for work and after he gets fired from another job. You celebrate successes with him and empathize with his frustrations. You share your story with him and listen to his story. You laugh with him and cry with him. If Stanley is just a client, your relationship with him ends when his progress in your program ends.</p>\n<p>We all need more friends in our life than we need program directors. We need more neighbors than case workers. And we need more family than we need professional care givers. That doesn’t mean that we never need professionals in our life or that it is somehow wrong to secure their help. What we all need is someone who will love us and encourage us even when we don’t make the best choices. It’s just harder for professionals to continue to be that loving person when we don’t get with the program or make our payments.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood focused, place-based work ascribes higher value to neighborly kindness and familial care than professional help because it is more in line with our long-term interests and basic needs. There is certainly room for professionals to help but that help should be temporary and leveraged in ways that clearly support one’s long-term interests. It also means that one should expect limits to what professionals will be willing to endure.</p>\n<p>I’ve known Stanley for a few years now. He needs a job. Although his wife is working, they are not quite making it and they may have to move out of the neighborhood they love so much. Their neighbors love them too. He and his wife regularly help their elderly neighbors with shopping and yard work. They participate in community meetings and helped start a community garden and newsletter. If they moved, it would really be a loss for the community. </p>\n<p>Stanley also really wants to work. He says he feels better about himself when he’s doing something productive and actively contributing to the family’s finances. He hasn’t done well in the manual labor jobs that he typically gets and thinks if he tries another route things will improve. His self-confidence is really low and he’s not convinced that he can do other, non-labor-intensive jobs but he is willing to try. In sum, he could use professional help to learn some new skills and he might benefit from some professional counseling as well. But Stanley, like all of us, is most in need of unconditional love and support that only family, friends, and neighbors provide. </p>\n<p>POLIS began piloting a program called Job Support Services earlier this year to help Stanley and 190 other people in his community who are out of work but looking for a job. The program helps residents apply to one of six employer partners who have agreed to give hiring priority to participants. Employers are willing to do that because we have assembled a team of volunteer residents and supportive partners who will help these applicants become great employees – child care, transportation, and encouragement will be provided.</p>\n<p>We have also partnered with larger training and job support programs like the one mentioned at the beginning of this article. They can still focus on specialized services that help people get jobs – resume writing, job interviewing skills, technical skills – while the resident volunteers provide the type of emotional and tactical support that will eventually help Stanley secure and keep a job. POLIS is providing professional design and support services during the pilot phase. When this phase concludes, our support will transition toward a resident-run program that helps ensure that everyone in the community that wants a job, has a job, and that when particular people like Stanley lose jobs or struggle to find work, friends and neighbors will be there to offer encouragement and connections.</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

Among his many achievements, Chef Miller also was named one of Food &amp; Wine magazine’s Best New Chefs of 2010, an accomplishment he is most proud of, although owning this restaurant might also rank high on his list.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike the storied reputations of many a hi-brow chef before him, Miller readily admits that he doesn’t know everything. “I’m not a plumber or an electrician” and building any business (food-based or otherwise) is about “surrounding yourself <span class=\"s1\">with talent and people who can complement your skills.</span> Gene Zimmerman, for example, brought to the table everything I didn’t have regarding the beverage industry,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So much goes into opening a restaurant, so much more than it takes to say, prepare a weekly menu for a family of four. It’s much more complicated than just being able to prepare quality food: it’s also about brokering deals, overseeing construction, <span class=\"s1\">understanding beverage orders, scheduling, </span>marketing, analyzing and shifting priorities when warranted. And more. Most importantly, perhaps, is in knowing what to buy, when to buy it and the value of what’s being purchased. A cerebral consideration when creating a menu and restaurant that is both approachable and affordable, as <span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span> is.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-9283 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-300x207.jpg?resize=300%2C207\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-300x207.jpg?resize=300%2C207 300w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-768x531.jpg 768w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-1024x708.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"technique driven French inspired food in the heart of Downtown Orlando only at DoveCote\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While some foodpreneurs follow rising and popular trends, Miller takes the long view. <strong>“You have to be sustainable, you have to make yourself and your business sustainable.”</strong> Build your business around what you do well and not what is “cool,” he advises.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">“At the end of the day, you’re the one on the line,” says Miller as he describes the experience of owning a restaurant. “It’s a different world; a different kind of pressure. Even with over 20 years’ industry experience, success is never guaranteed.&#8221; as this chef can attest.</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">In his own experience, Miller thought he would “hit it out of the park” with <span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span>, but the restaurant is growing slower than he anticipated. “That’s life. You take chances,” he says with no regrets. The life of a foodpreneur is sometimes risky, but thankfully for Chef Miller, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"599\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/dovecote-brings-french-infusion-to-downtown/fullsizerender_3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" data-orig-size=\"640,480\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 7 Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1483439794&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.076923076923077&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender_3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=300%2C225\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-599\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=357%2C268\" alt=\"muffins and pasteries at DoveCote pair wonderfully with coffee for early morning meetings\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=600%2C450 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=230%2C173 230w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=350%2C263 350w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=480%2C360 480w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?w=640 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span> continues to grow in popularity as word of mouth spreads among the businesses and residents of Downtown Orlando about this culinary gem. Miller has crafted an accessible<br />\n(affordable and recognizable) menu that is open for early morning coffee and pastries, lunch and dinner and Sunday Brunch. Sought after classics such as Steak and Frites, Caramelized French Onion Soup and Chicken and Sausage Cassoulet accompany other comfort dishes like Crab and Gruyere Quiche and Brioche French Toast. A thoughtful list of wines by the glass, unique cocktails and craft beers round out the list.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Miller looks forward to continuing his foodpreneuer journey as he builds his brand through DoveCote and by participating in the local food scene that is dominating Central Florida. We look forward to more great things to come from Chef Miller.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"597\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/dovecote-brings-french-infusion-to-downtown/fullsizerender_1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" data-orig-size=\"640,480\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 7 Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1483439769&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.2&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender_1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?fit=300%2C225\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-597 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=640%2C480\" alt=\"DoveCote Bar currated by Gene Zimmer of The Courtesy\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?w=640 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=600%2C450 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=230%2C173 230w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=350%2C263 350w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_1.jpg?resize=480%2C360 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<table class=\"t1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Author- Kristine Thomas; first published in <span style=\"color: #000080;\">i4 Business Magazine</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Fdovecote-brings-french-infusion-to-downtown%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/dovecote-brings-french-infusion-to-downtown/\">DoveCote Brings French Infusion to Downtown</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>",

Among his many achievements, Chef Miller also was named one of Food &amp; Wine magazine’s Best New Chefs of 2010, an accomplishment he is most proud of, although owning this restaurant might also rank high on his list.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike the storied reputations of many a hi-brow chef before him, Miller readily admits that he doesn’t know everything. “I’m not a plumber or an electrician” and building any business (food-based or otherwise) is about “surrounding yourself <span class=\"s1\">with talent and people who can complement your skills.</span> Gene Zimmerman, for example, brought to the table everything I didn’t have regarding the beverage industry,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So much goes into opening a restaurant, so much more than it takes to say, prepare a weekly menu for a family of four. It’s much more complicated than just being able to prepare quality food: it’s also about brokering deals, overseeing construction, <span class=\"s1\">understanding beverage orders, scheduling, </span>marketing, analyzing and shifting priorities when warranted. And more. Most importantly, perhaps, is in knowing what to buy, when to buy it and the value of what’s being purchased. A cerebral consideration when creating a menu and restaurant that is both approachable and affordable, as <span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span> is.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-9283 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-300x207.jpg?resize=300%2C207\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-300x207.jpg?resize=300%2C207 300w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-768x531.jpg 768w, http://www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Salmon-1024x708.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"technique driven French inspired food in the heart of Downtown Orlando only at DoveCote\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While some foodpreneurs follow rising and popular trends, Miller takes the long view. <strong>“You have to be sustainable, you have to make yourself and your business sustainable.”</strong> Build your business around what you do well and not what is “cool,” he advises.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">“At the end of the day, you’re the one on the line,” says Miller as he describes the experience of owning a restaurant. “It’s a different world; a different kind of pressure. Even with over 20 years’ industry experience, success is never guaranteed.&#8221; as this chef can attest.</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">In his own experience, Miller thought he would “hit it out of the park” with <span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span>, but the restaurant is growing slower than he anticipated. “That’s life. You take chances,” he says with no regrets. The life of a foodpreneur is sometimes risky, but thankfully for Chef Miller, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"599\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/dovecote-brings-french-infusion-to-downtown/fullsizerender_3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" data-orig-size=\"640,480\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 7 Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1483439794&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.076923076923077&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender_3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=300%2C225\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?fit=640%2C480\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-599\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=357%2C268\" alt=\"muffins and pasteries at DoveCote pair wonderfully with coffee for early morning meetings\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=600%2C450 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=230%2C173 230w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=350%2C263 350w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?resize=480%2C360 480w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FullSizeRender_3.jpg?w=640 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">DoveCote</span> continues to grow in popularity as word of mouth spreads among the businesses and residents of Downtown Orlando about this culinary gem.

Sought after classics such as Steak and Frites, Caramelized French Onion Soup and Chicken and Sausage Cassoulet accompany other comfort dishes like Crab and Gruyere Quiche and Brioche French Toast. A thoughtful list of wines by the glass, unique cocktails and craft beers round out the list.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Miller looks forward to continuing his foodpreneuer journey as he builds his brand through DoveCote and by participating in the local food scene that is dominating Central Florida.

Some food tours are running it as a business, while others such as ORL Food Lab are just hoping to elevate awareness for the local food scene.<br />\nORL Food Lab usually charges about $15 for the events. But Thomas said the group is not making a profit and uses proceeds to cover food costs from participating eateries.</p>\n<h3>Education is a common thread among many of the ancillary groups popping up around the food industry, but eating is always involved.</h3>\n<p>“It’s not just going to a restaurant, but getting a more in-depth look at the food system,” said Ricky Ly, a local blogger who runs TastyChomps.com and is a full-time civil engineer. “A big factor is the internet and Food Network, where people are getting an extra close look inside restaurants and how their food is made.”<img data-attachment-id=\"20\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/local-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs/rickyly/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=463%2C515\" data-orig-size=\"463,515\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RickyLy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=270%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=463%2C515\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20 alignright\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?resize=463%2C515\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?w=463 463w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?resize=270%2C300 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Another nonprofit group is launching an event starting March 1 called Orlando Foodstock, with four days of events around town highlighting different restaurant districts. It costs $49 a night for events on Church Street, Pointe Orlando and I-Drive 360; access is free to the fourth event, which will feature food trucks at Black Cauldron Taproom &amp; Brewery.</p>\n<p>Organizer Mary Jo Ross said she was hoping to create a multi-day festival similar to food celebrations in cities such as Miami. Events will take place both downtown and on International Drive. The difference from other events such as the Downtown Orlando Food &amp; Wine Fest, Ross said, is that the food is free after entry. Proceeds support scholarships for local culinary students.</p>\n<p>“For years we were a commercial restaurant community built around the theme parks and national chains,” Ross said. “Now because we have so many wonderful chefs and destination experiences, we have one of the most diverse collections of food entrepreneurs of any city in the country.”</p>\n<p>Foodstock, Ross said, will be aimed more at local restaurateurs and chefs.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"476\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/img_6798/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=2256%2C1504\" data-orig-size=\"2256,1504\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS REBEL T3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1446829811&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;29&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;3200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.005&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_6798\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-476\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=600%2C400 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\nAnother growing trend, food tours, is giving inside access to the restaurants as well as the people behind them.</p>\n<p>A new company launched in September called Sanford Food Tours combines a walk through historic areas of Seminole County seat with a behind-the-scenes look and tasting session at local restaurants. Chefs and owners from Tennessee Truffle, Smiling Bison and marshmallow maker Wondermade make appearances and sometimes give samples of experimental dishes.</p>\n<p>The tours cost $40, similar to tour companies started recently in Winter Park and downtown Orlando. Sanford’s tours are usually held around lunch and often on weekends to give access to restaurants during off-peak hours. Bookings are made through the Sanford Food Tours website.</p>\n<p>“Where else can you go and listen to a local chef talk about their family recipe for apple strudel and how they got their business off the ground,” Sanford Food Tours owner Steve Tishman said. “And sometimes if we’re lucky, the chef will even come out and give us a taste of a new dish they are experimenting with.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Article written by Kyle Arnold &#8211; first published in the Orlando Sentinel</span></p>\n<p>karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; Twitter, @kylelarnold or facebook.com/bykylearnold</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Flocal-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/local-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs/\">Local foodie culture spurs lectures, inspires entrepreneurs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>",

Some food tours are running it as a business, while others such as ORL Food Lab are just hoping to elevate awareness for the local food scene.<br />\nORL Food Lab usually charges about $15 for the events. But Thomas said the group is not making a profit and uses proceeds to cover food costs from participating eateries.</p>\n<h3>Education is a common thread among many of the ancillary groups popping up around the food industry, but eating is always involved.</h3>\n<p>“It’s not just going to a restaurant, but getting a more in-depth look at the food system,” said Ricky Ly, a local blogger who runs TastyChomps.com and is a full-time civil engineer. “A big factor is the internet and Food Network, where people are getting an extra close look inside restaurants and how their food is made.”<img data-attachment-id=\"20\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/local-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs/rickyly/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=463%2C515\" data-orig-size=\"463,515\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RickyLy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=270%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?fit=463%2C515\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20 alignright\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?resize=463%2C515\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?w=463 463w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RickyLy.jpg?resize=270%2C300 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Another nonprofit group is launching an event starting March 1 called Orlando Foodstock, with four days of events around town highlighting different restaurant districts. It costs $49 a night for events on Church Street, Pointe Orlando and I-Drive 360; access is free to the fourth event, which will feature food trucks at Black Cauldron Taproom &amp; Brewery.</p>\n<p>Organizer Mary Jo Ross said she was hoping to create a multi-day festival similar to food celebrations in cities such as Miami. Events will take place both downtown and on International Drive. The difference from other events such as the Downtown Orlando Food &amp; Wine Fest, Ross said, is that the food is free after entry. Proceeds support scholarships for local culinary students.</p>\n<p>“For years we were a commercial restaurant community built around the theme parks and national chains,” Ross said. “Now because we have so many wonderful chefs and destination experiences, we have one of the most diverse collections of food entrepreneurs of any city in the country.”</p>\n<p>Foodstock, Ross said, will be aimed more at local restaurateurs and chefs.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"476\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/img_6798/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=2256%2C1504\" data-orig-size=\"2256,1504\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS REBEL T3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1446829811&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;29&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;3200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.005&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_6798\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-476\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6798.jpg?resize=600%2C400 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\nAnother growing trend, food tours, is giving inside access to the restaurants as well as the people behind them.</p>\n<p>A new company launched in September called Sanford Food Tours combines a walk through historic areas of Seminole County seat with a behind-the-scenes look and tasting session at local restaurants. Chefs and owners from Tennessee Truffle, Smiling Bison and marshmallow maker Wondermade make appearances and sometimes give samples of experimental dishes.</p>\n<p>The tours cost $40, similar to tour companies started recently in Winter Park and downtown Orlando. Sanford’s tours are usually held around lunch and often on weekends to give access to restaurants during off-peak hours. Bookings are made through the Sanford Food Tours website.</p>\n<p>“Where else can you go and listen to a local chef talk about their family recipe for apple strudel and how they got their business off the ground,” Sanford Food Tours owner Steve Tishman said. “And sometimes if we’re lucky, the chef will even come out and give us a taste of a new dish they are experimenting with.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Article written by Kyle Arnold &#8211; first published in the Orlando Sentinel</span></p>\n<p>karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; Twitter, @kylelarnold or facebook.com/bykylearnold</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Flocal-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/local-foodie-culture-spurs-lectures-inspires-entrepreneurs/\">Local foodie culture spurs lectures, inspires entrepreneurs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>"

    "description": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xfU9cqsDv66vrkAtwo6arw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I made the mistake yesterday of getting sucked into watching how some people react when they don’t get their way. I was quickly filled with darkness as I watched and said in my heart… “So this is what it has come down to.”</p><p>Why does God get out of the way in front of all the injustices in the world yet seems to stand in our way when we don’t get what we want?</p><p>How do you think about the challenges you face in your life right now? What are your reactions truly exposing about you that you would hate to admit? I’ll go ahead and throw myself under the bus first…</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4fnV_oRE0Q0ph0AAe8VFmw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I can have the capacity for true darkness in my soul. I could get angry enough to not know what I am capable of if faced with certain situations I felt were threatening to my life or my loved ones. I hate to admit it, but I don’t know if I would have the control needed over myself if I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>My lack of faith is greatly exposed in these times and can react badly in my heart to what is in front of me. Strangers with different ways of dealing with their realities, friends who don’t think, feel, or breathe passionatley the same way I do. I want vengenace and redemption all at once! I am not in control, yet want it all under control and God silently steps out of the way and for so many others too.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1BxkmXEgPAtqzsT2DrXLQg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I’m actually finding, the more I stick it out with God, things don’t get easier. They get more real and my best bet is to faithfully trust that this life is hard for a reason. Pain has a purpose but God will use it for higher things that we can not understand yet.</p><p>I know God can remove every pain and suffering from my life and your’s, but I do not know why He doesn’t. I know He loves you just as much as He loves me and I don’t believe this is all we get. Like a prodigal, we have a father who will get out of our way when He needs to, but will also run straight for us, tears in his eyes, to meet us in our darkest and deepest pains. And when we need to find our way back home, may we run believing in our hearts that this story is not over just yet.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VMec00YB3yWkQXrheU__IQ.jpeg\" /></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ba7839986bb7\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">",

I was quickly filled with darkness as I watched and said in my heart… “So this is what it has come down to.”</p><p>Why does God get out of the way in front of all the injustices in the world yet seems to stand in our way when we don’t get what we want?</p><p>How do you think about the challenges you face in your life right now? What are your reactions truly exposing about you that you would hate to admit? I’ll go ahead and throw myself under the bus first…</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4fnV_oRE0Q0ph0AAe8VFmw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I can have the capacity for true darkness in my soul. I could get angry enough to not know what I am capable of if faced with certain situations I felt were threatening to my life or my loved ones. I hate to admit it, but I don’t know if I would have the control needed over myself if I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>My lack of faith is greatly exposed in these times and can react badly in my heart to what is in front of me. Strangers with different ways of dealing with their realities, friends who don’t think, feel, or breathe passionatley the same way I do. I want vengenace and redemption all at once! I am not in control, yet want it all under control and God silently steps out of the way and for so many others too.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1BxkmXEgPAtqzsT2DrXLQg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I’m actually finding, the more I stick it out with God, things don’t get easier. They get more real and my best bet is to faithfully trust that this life is hard for a reason. Pain has a purpose but God will use it for higher things that we can not understand yet.</p><p>I know God can remove every pain and suffering from my life and your’s, but I do not know why He doesn’t. I know He loves you just as much as He loves me and I don’t believe this is all we get. Like a prodigal, we have a father who will get out of our way when He needs to, but will also run straight for us, tears in his eyes, to meet us in our darkest and deepest pains. And when we need to find our way back home, may we run believing in our hearts that this story is not over just yet.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VMec00YB3yWkQXrheU__IQ.jpeg\" /></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ba7839986bb7\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Sprint as hard as humanly possible just to keep up with the competition. That feeling came quickly…almost hauntingly as I started looking forward to this new year while my fingers filled with blood again.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cXMAPWWNSV7SCFy_l408eA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I had to ask a different question this year. Why am I sprinting? How far has it gotten me and how fast did it all go by? Back then, last year, this year. Am I afraid I’ll miss out on something? What am I still missing this year? I’ve sprinted all my life…and for what?</p><p>Progress, acceleration, immediacy… always hallow, always imperfect, always our greatest missed opportunity. Maybe next year will be the year…</p><p>How much are we rushing through life though? How much personal training are you going to commit to before things are perfect?</p><p>Take the opportunity to do something totally counterintuitive this year. If you start something new, intentionally do it slow. Plan on it taking a lot of your time or maybe… don’t even set a deadline. Enjoy the thing in it’s most imperfect state and keep finding purpose in why you do the thing at all and dream about it’s potential.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zaZHsXKP5yePmHjzQJ8rPA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I guess its a good time to thank God for that kind of mercy on us. All our imperfections, habits, anxieties, and selfishness. Thank you Lord! I don’t have to get 2017 perfect or expect it to be just that.</p><p>Whatever you get caught up in this year, don’t miss the opportunities in things being imperfect. If the God of perfection moves toward and pursues us at our most imperfect state, what does 2017 look like if it doesn’t have to be perfect, but it could just be purposeful and with heart.</p><p>Love you all.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f63f59b7fcc5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">",

Sprint as hard as humanly possible just to keep up with the competition. That feeling came quickly…almost hauntingly as I started looking forward to this new year while my fingers filled with blood again.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cXMAPWWNSV7SCFy_l408eA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I had to ask a different question this year. Why am I sprinting? How far has it gotten me and how fast did it all go by? Back then, last year, this year. Am I afraid I’ll miss out on something? What am I still missing this year? I’ve sprinted all my life…and for what?</p><p>Progress, acceleration, immediacy… always hallow, always imperfect, always our greatest missed opportunity. Maybe next year will be the year…</p><p>How much are we rushing through life though? How much personal training are you going to commit to before things are perfect?</p><p>Take the opportunity to do something totally counterintuitive this year. If you start something new, intentionally do it slow. Plan on it taking a lot of your time or maybe… don’t even set a deadline. Enjoy the thing in it’s most imperfect state and keep finding purpose in why you do the thing at all and dream about it’s potential.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zaZHsXKP5yePmHjzQJ8rPA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>I guess its a good time to thank God for that kind of mercy on us. All our imperfections, habits, anxieties, and selfishness. Thank you Lord! I don’t have to get 2017 perfect or expect it to be just that.</p><p>Whatever you get caught up in this year, don’t miss the opportunities in things being imperfect. If the God of perfection moves toward and pursues us at our most imperfect state, what does 2017 look like if it doesn’t have to be perfect, but it could just be purposeful and with heart.</p><p>Love you all.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f63f59b7fcc5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

While in Seattle, Tom joined the Navy, spending four years in Japan. Following his navy career, Tom finished his degree in finance and moved to Washington. Tom worked in Seattle’s corporate world up until 2009. It was his work in corporate business that finally brought him to “the city beautiful”, Orlando. So what inspires a corporate business man to start a brewery?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems Tom and girlfriend, Ana Barrientos, shared a passion for cold brews. The two visited craft beer establishments and even began brewing their own beer. This passion for brewing soon became an obsession and the couple continue to buy more and more brewing equipment.  “I questioned myself if I should just open a brewery, and well, I think everyone knows what I decided to do.” says Tom. Together with his partner in life and business, Ana , Deadly Sins Brewing was underway. <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/ORL-Food/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"473\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/?attachment_id=473\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=960%2C1280\" data-orig-size=\"960,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1390388220&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;2.18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.058823529411765&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_1390\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=225%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=768%2C1024\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-473 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"Deadly Sins Brewing - Central Florida foodpreneur\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=600%2C800 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?w=960 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deadly Sins Brewing had it’s soft-opening on July 15th of 2016. Located at 750 Jackson Ave. The 4,000 square foot property is in an industrial area of Winter Park, off Fairbanks and behind the popular 4Rivers Smokehouse.

Tom tells us, “ I have been surprised by all the customers that come in and are so helpful to see us succeed.  They go out of their way to help spread the word or book events that help us.” When it comes to his biggest challenge, Tom says “it was acquiring all of the necessary equipment that provided the biggest challenge.” However, Tom gives a shout-out to many of the local Orlando Breweries that were so helpful with their willingness to work with him to source items for Deadly Sins Brewing, as well as, answering each of his questions. The Central Florida food community seems to be more than willing to help others succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/ORL-Food/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"472\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/?attachment_id=472\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX K-50&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1356998424&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"grandopening-10-15-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=300%2C199\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C678\" class=\"alignright wp-image-472 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=300%2C199\" alt=\"Deadly Sins Brewing - Central Florida foodpreneur\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=300%2C199 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?w=2340 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?w=3510 3510w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was also extremely lucky that the city of Winter Park worked with me and was very timely in getting my permits approved.” If the costs don’t hinder s foodpreneur,  often times the city, state and county stipulations can be be difficult to navigate and may ultimately put foodpreneur dreams to an end.

While in Seattle, Tom joined the Navy, spending four years in Japan. Following his navy career, Tom finished his degree in finance and moved to Washington. Tom worked in Seattle’s corporate world up until 2009. It was his work in corporate business that finally brought him to “the city beautiful”, Orlando. So what inspires a corporate business man to start a brewery?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems Tom and girlfriend, Ana Barrientos, shared a passion for cold brews. The two visited craft beer establishments and even began brewing their own beer. This passion for brewing soon became an obsession and the couple continue to buy more and more brewing equipment.  “I questioned myself if I should just open a brewery, and well, I think everyone knows what I decided to do.” says Tom. Together with his partner in life and business, Ana , Deadly Sins Brewing was underway. <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/ORL-Food/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"473\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/?attachment_id=473\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=960%2C1280\" data-orig-size=\"960,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1390388220&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;2.18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.058823529411765&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"img_1390\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=225%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?fit=768%2C1024\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-473 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"Deadly Sins Brewing - Central Florida foodpreneur\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?resize=600%2C800 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1390.jpg?w=960 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deadly Sins Brewing had it’s soft-opening on July 15th of 2016. Located at 750 Jackson Ave. The 4,000 square foot property is in an industrial area of Winter Park, off Fairbanks and behind the popular 4Rivers Smokehouse. A simple setup, reminiscent of some of the original breweries, the family (and dog) friendly establishment is open seven days a week with live music every Friday and Saturday night.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Helping Others Succeed</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having been opened a few months now, Deadly Sins Brewing seems to be doing quite well. Tom tells us, “ I have been surprised by all the customers that come in and are so helpful to see us succeed.  They go out of their way to help spread the word or book events that help us.” When it comes to his biggest challenge, Tom says “it was acquiring all of the necessary equipment that provided the biggest challenge.” However, Tom gives a shout-out to many of the local Orlando Breweries that were so helpful with their willingness to work with him to source items for Deadly Sins Brewing, as well as, answering each of his questions. The Central Florida food community seems to be more than willing to help others succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/ORL-Food/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"472\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/?attachment_id=472\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX K-50&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1356998424&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"grandopening-10-15-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=300%2C199\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C678\" class=\"alignright wp-image-472 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=300%2C199\" alt=\"Deadly Sins Brewing - Central Florida foodpreneur\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=300%2C199 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?w=2340 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GRANDOPENING.10.15-1.jpg?w=3510 3510w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was also extremely lucky that the city of Winter Park worked with me and was very timely in getting my permits approved.” If the costs don’t hinder s foodpreneur,  often times the city, state and county stipulations can be be difficult to navigate and may ultimately put foodpreneur dreams to an end. Though Tom was well aware of these things and had his business plan in-order within a month and within three months had already acquired a business loan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a background in business in finance was certainly of help to Tom in his planning. “Of course there are always unforeseen costs, but that was due mostly to equipment delays,” says Tom. “My build out went smooth and thanks to the City of Winter Park they allowed me to open my tap room while I waited on the equipment.  If this had not happened I don&#8217;t think I would have made it&#8221;.

It can be tempting to forget about things that used to be important. We can justify many times to stop g0ing out of our way for the ones in and around our life.</p><p>However, it is still possible to believe that God came to us in the garden and asked “Where are you?” Or that God himself came in a manger and found a way to still be with us.</p><p>We remember a lot of things during the holidays. Times we miss, relationships that are extremely fragile, places in our hearts where we somehow managed to hold onto hope through the year and still seek the peace and the joy we long for and are meant for.</p><p>While we let Christmas remind us of many of these truths in our lives, be reminded that God is still with us. Still pursuing us. Still remembering us.</p><p>Let this Christmas be the reminder that triumphs over all else…that God and man get to restart together and that the joy that can be available this time of year is just the beginning of where we are going.</p><p>We will find our way back. We will be remembered. The ransomed of the Lord shall return.</p><p>It will take some serious faith and God can give you that.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IpuLNcuTfDbb_1W_n153-w.png\" /></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dd9af8cb3d9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">",

It can be tempting to forget about things that used to be important. We can justify many times to stop g0ing out of our way for the ones in and around our life.</p><p>However, it is still possible to believe that God came to us in the garden and asked “Where are you?” Or that God himself came in a manger and found a way to still be with us.</p><p>We remember a lot of things during the holidays. Times we miss, relationships that are extremely fragile, places in our hearts where we somehow managed to hold onto hope through the year and still seek the peace and the joy we long for and are meant for.</p><p>While we let Christmas remind us of many of these truths in our lives, be reminded that God is still with us. Still pursuing us. Still remembering us.</p><p>Let this Christmas be the reminder that triumphs over all else…that God and man get to restart together and that the joy that can be available this time of year is just the beginning of where we are going.</p><p>We will find our way back. We will be remembered. The ransomed of the Lord shall return.</p><p>It will take some serious faith and God can give you that.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IpuLNcuTfDbb_1W_n153-w.png\" /></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dd9af8cb3d9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Perhaps it&#8217;s the monthly COOP meeting that inspires you or reminds you that people care about and are invested in our city&#8217;s well-being. Or maybe one of our initiatives shifted the way you view and value other people and how you do the work that you do. Whatever the impact you feel POLIS has made in your life, we encourage you to share your story on #MyGivingStory this holiday.</p>\n<p>From #MyGivingStory:<br />\n<em>#MyGivingStory is a nationwide campaign and social media storytelling contest that will foster a public discussion about the reasons people give. Working in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.givingtuesday.org/www.gatesfoundation.org\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givingtuesday.org/www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a>, “everyday givers” reflect upon why they give to a certain nonprofit organization and then share these personal stories on social media. (The winners’ featured nonprofit organizations will receive $2,500-10,000 grants.)</em></p>\n<p>If you feel like you don&#8217;t have a lot to give this year, remember there are many ways to give back to the people and organizations that have shaped you &#8211; lend your voice and experience this year by <a href=\"https://www.givingtuesday.org/mygivingstory\">filling out this short form</a>.

The Farmacy is best described as a small, local and organic grocery store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Farmacy, however, is not your typical grocer carrying organic fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs and a few basic kitchen pantry essentials. The Farmacy distinguishes itself by carrying only organic products, and more importantly, it carries a great deal of local products by partnering with over twenty-four farmers throughout Central Florida. These local farms range in size from small micro and specialty farms, to public farms such as Lake Meadows Natural (familiar to many Central Floridians), as well as, lesser known mom and pop businesses including a raw dairy farmer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It&#8217;s pretty surprising how much community support for The Farmacy has grown over the last two and a half years, and even more surprising to find out how much work you can </span>accomplish in that same amount of time,” says Cathy Clay.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"479\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=768%2C960\" data-orig-size=\"768,960\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=240%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=768%2C960\" class=\"alignright wp-image-479 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=240%2C300\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=240%2C300 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?w=768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=600%2C750 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Going with the Flow or is it the Grow?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cathy began her foodpreneur journey by exploring healthy food which led to the idea of food farming, and soon after, she and Robby dreamed of having a small ten acre farm all their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple frequented the Winter Garden Farmers Market regularly, always certain to arrive early so as not to miss out on Cathy’s favorite organic kale. It was on one of these outings that Robby and Cathy drove past a yard sale in an old barn. Stopping for a garage sale was not Cathy’s highest priority at the moment and she reminded Robby, “we can’t miss the kale”. However, it took very little time for Cathy to change her mind. The couple decided, “You don’t pass up a garage sale in an old barn.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The barn belonged to an older couple that the Clay’s soon befriended. Cathy began working at the local ‘farm to table’ farm so as to gain experience for her own dream of having a future farm. The farmers Cathy essentially interned with, had a surplus of kale that was not going to be sold and like true foodpreneurs, Robby and Cathy popped up a tent of their own at the Winter Garden Farmers Market. “We sold lots of kale, and it snowballed from there.  Robby and I started with one farm, added another, then another, and now we are up to twenty-four local farms and several other makers who supply goods to our store.  We didn&#8217;t start out with plans to be at a farmers market, much less a store, but people were asking us for it, so we went with it and kept growing!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Farmacy made its debut by selling produce out of a small tent in a busy farmers market and gained many loyal followers.</span>  Although The Farmacy has grown, its focus remains the same, “We want to be able to reach even more people with healthy, organic, and local (whenever possible) foods, and we also want to support our local farmers and keep them growing,” says Cathy. The Farmacy is more than a grocery store, it is a place for community.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"477\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=691%2C691\" data-orig-size=\"691,691\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=691%2C691\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-477 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=691%2C691\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?w=691 691w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Let Food Be Thy Medicine</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What advice does this couple offer for foodpreneurs (food entrepreneurs) wanting to start a profitable business?  “START SMALL! “ exclaims Cathy, “The less overhead that you start out with the better, it will give YOU a chance to grow with the business, and will allow you the freedom to keep doing what you are doing because you love it, not because you owe on some huge startup business debt.” The Clay&#8217;s share that they are most proud of, “starting something from scratch, without any startup funding, that really has been beneficial to so many people; from our customers to our farmers and our team members.  We love being able to serve our community, and we hope to keep doing that well. “ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The community the Clay’s seek to serve is the very same community that inspires them to move forward with a second location in the heart of downtown Orlando (Opening late November 2016). The Farmacy will be teaming of with Downtown Credo Coffee and Pop Parlor to bring us, The North Quarter Market. Expanding is not without its challenges, “I think probably keeping up with the demands of a growing business, and sacrificing the time and effort it takes to get something started from the ground up.  It&#8217;s more work than you could ever imagine, but also more rewarding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our mission,” says the foodpreneur couple, “is to promote health and wellness by providing natural, healthy food choices to the community. By providing locally sourced food, we reconnect people with their food sources while sustaining local, all natural farms. We encourage others to get back to the Farm and away from the Pharmacy, and to ‘Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.’”</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"478\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy-logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=960%2C960\" data-orig-size=\"960,960\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy-logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=960%2C960\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-478 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?w=960 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Fmeet-your-farmacists%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/\">The Farmacy Brings Local and Organic to Central Florida</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>",

These local farms range in size from small micro and specialty farms, to public farms such as Lake Meadows Natural (familiar to many Central Floridians), as well as, lesser known mom and pop businesses including a raw dairy farmer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It&#8217;s pretty surprising how much community support for The Farmacy has grown over the last two and a half years, and even more surprising to find out how much work you can </span>accomplish in that same amount of time,” says Cathy Clay.<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"479\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=768%2C960\" data-orig-size=\"768,960\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=240%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?fit=768%2C960\" class=\"alignright wp-image-479 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=240%2C300\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=240%2C300 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?w=768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy.jpg?resize=600%2C750 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Going with the Flow or is it the Grow?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cathy began her foodpreneur journey by exploring healthy food which led to the idea of food farming, and soon after, she and Robby dreamed of having a small ten acre farm all their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple frequented the Winter Garden Farmers Market regularly, always certain to arrive early so as not to miss out on Cathy’s favorite organic kale. It was on one of these outings that Robby and Cathy drove past a yard sale in an old barn. Stopping for a garage sale was not Cathy’s highest priority at the moment and she reminded Robby, “we can’t miss the kale”. However, it took very little time for Cathy to change her mind. The couple decided, “You don’t pass up a garage sale in an old barn.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The barn belonged to an older couple that the Clay’s soon befriended. Cathy began working at the local ‘farm to table’ farm so as to gain experience for her own dream of having a future farm. The farmers Cathy essentially interned with, had a surplus of kale that was not going to be sold and like true foodpreneurs, Robby and Cathy popped up a tent of their own at the Winter Garden Farmers Market. “We sold lots of kale, and it snowballed from there.  Robby and I started with one farm, added another, then another, and now we are up to twenty-four local farms and several other makers who supply goods to our store.  We didn&#8217;t start out with plans to be at a farmers market, much less a store, but people were asking us for it, so we went with it and kept growing!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Farmacy made its debut by selling produce out of a small tent in a busy farmers market and gained many loyal followers.</span>  Although The Farmacy has grown, its focus remains the same, “We want to be able to reach even more people with healthy, organic, and local (whenever possible) foods, and we also want to support our local farmers and keep them growing,” says Cathy. The Farmacy is more than a grocery store, it is a place for community.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"477\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=691%2C691\" data-orig-size=\"691,691\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?fit=691%2C691\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-477 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=691%2C691\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?w=691 691w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy3.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Let Food Be Thy Medicine</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What advice does this couple offer for foodpreneurs (food entrepreneurs) wanting to start a profitable business?  “START SMALL! “ exclaims Cathy, “The less overhead that you start out with the better, it will give YOU a chance to grow with the business, and will allow you the freedom to keep doing what you are doing because you love it, not because you owe on some huge startup business debt.” The Clay&#8217;s share that they are most proud of, “starting something from scratch, without any startup funding, that really has been beneficial to so many people; from our customers to our farmers and our team members.  We love being able to serve our community, and we hope to keep doing that well. “ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The community the Clay’s seek to serve is the very same community that inspires them to move forward with a second location in the heart of downtown Orlando (Opening late November 2016). The Farmacy will be teaming of with Downtown Credo Coffee and Pop Parlor to bring us, The North Quarter Market. Expanding is not without its challenges, “I think probably keeping up with the demands of a growing business, and sacrificing the time and effort it takes to get something started from the ground up.  It&#8217;s more work than you could ever imagine, but also more rewarding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our mission,” says the foodpreneur couple, “is to promote health and wellness by providing natural, healthy food choices to the community. By providing locally sourced food, we reconnect people with their food sources while sustaining local, all natural farms. We encourage others to get back to the Farm and away from the Pharmacy, and to ‘Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.’”</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefarmacy/?fref=ts\"><img data-attachment-id=\"478\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/the-farmacy-logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=960%2C960\" data-orig-size=\"960,960\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"the-farmacy-logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?fit=960%2C960\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-478 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"The Farmacy of Orlando - local organic food\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-farmacy-logo.jpg?w=960 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Fmeet-your-farmacists%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/meet-your-farmacists/\">The Farmacy Brings Local and Organic to Central Florida</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>"

    "title": "Helping Residents Pursue Their Own Goals",
    "description": "<p>One of the most important aspects of a life well-lived is the discovery and pursuit of one&#8217;s own goals and aspirations. For those of us who practice Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD), this is a fundamental part of the work &#8211; helping residents of a small geographic area leverage their skills and networks to realize their dreams. Connecting the dreams of particular residents to one another and those shared dreams to the overall transformation of a community is where the work gets exciting.</p>\n<p>As straightforward as this sounds, this type of emphasis is quite rare. There are a few reasons for this, most of which are not bad. First, funding sources for programs tend to want to know what you plan to do before they give you the money. Makes sense. But then, that&#8217;s what you have to do. And if your grant was written to improve health outcomes in a community whose stated priority is jobs, then you have a conflict on your hands. The solution to this is to simply include a discovery phase for grants and to allow some ability to adjust to what is discovered.</p>\n<p>Similarly, non-profits tend to get started to address a single, specific issue like homelessness, employability, school grades, or blindness to name a few. They then scale their work as they successfully help their clients address the issue. When the potential client-base is a city of over 200,000 people or a county of over a million people, a non-profit can continue its march towards excellence and success because it can and will focus its attention on those clients most amenable to what they have to offer. When the client-base is the residents of a particular neighborhood of 1,500 people, everything changes. And the business model of most non-profits simply will not survive that scale.</p>\n<p>The solution to this is quite simple. Simply create a program whose sole purpose is to help the neighborhood residents establish and meet their goals while bringing in specialist partners who can help the residents succeed in particular areas. The biggest challenge to this is establishing sufficient trust to allow people to share their goals in the first place. Asking people what they are hoping to achieve in life is way more personal that asking them to show up to a cooking class. And this is one of the reasons that organizations don&#8217;t tend to do this type of work &#8211; it takes a very long time to build trusting relationships. But that is what we all need and desire in life.</p>\n<p>We call this a Resident and Community Support Program after a program run by the East Lake Foundation in Atlanta. We are implementing a similar program on behalf of LIFT Orlando called MVP Families. Pictured above is Porcha, one of the core members of the program. The other day she took me aside to tell me how grateful she was for the program. She has now established her own goals for her family and is getting to connected to the best practices and some programs to help achieve these goals.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the numbers (as of Oct. 2016):</p>\n<p>Total MVP Families:           55</p>\n<p>Children:                                98</p>\n<p>Avg.

      "#": "<p>One of the most important aspects of a life well-lived is the discovery and pursuit of one&#8217;s own goals and aspirations. For those of us who practice Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD), this is a fundamental part of the work &#8211; helping residents of a small geographic area leverage their skills and networks to realize their dreams. Connecting the dreams of particular residents to one another and those shared dreams to the overall transformation of a community is where the work gets exciting.</p>\n<p>As straightforward as this sounds, this type of emphasis is quite rare. There are a few reasons for this, most of which are not bad. First, funding sources for programs tend to want to know what you plan to do before they give you the money. Makes sense. But then, that&#8217;s what you have to do. And if your grant was written to improve health outcomes in a community whose stated priority is jobs, then you have a conflict on your hands. The solution to this is to simply include a discovery phase for grants and to allow some ability to adjust to what is discovered.</p>\n<p>Similarly, non-profits tend to get started to address a single, specific issue like homelessness, employability, school grades, or blindness to name a few. They then scale their work as they successfully help their clients address the issue. When the potential client-base is a city of over 200,000 people or a county of over a million people, a non-profit can continue its march towards excellence and success because it can and will focus its attention on those clients most amenable to what they have to offer. When the client-base is the residents of a particular neighborhood of 1,500 people, everything changes. And the business model of most non-profits simply will not survive that scale.</p>\n<p>The solution to this is quite simple. Simply create a program whose sole purpose is to help the neighborhood residents establish and meet their goals while bringing in specialist partners who can help the residents succeed in particular areas. The biggest challenge to this is establishing sufficient trust to allow people to share their goals in the first place. Asking people what they are hoping to achieve in life is way more personal that asking them to show up to a cooking class. And this is one of the reasons that organizations don&#8217;t tend to do this type of work &#8211; it takes a very long time to build trusting relationships. But that is what we all need and desire in life.</p>\n<p>We call this a Resident and Community Support Program after a program run by the East Lake Foundation in Atlanta. We are implementing a similar program on behalf of LIFT Orlando called MVP Families. Pictured above is Porcha, one of the core members of the program. The other day she took me aside to tell me how grateful she was for the program. She has now established her own goals for her family and is getting to connected to the best practices and some programs to help achieve these goals.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the numbers (as of Oct. 2016):</p>\n<p>Total MVP Families:           55</p>\n<p>Children:                                98</p>\n<p>Avg. GPA:                               3.192</p>\n<p>Over 2.0 GPA:                       93.3%</p>\n<p>Established Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Children&#8217;s Academic Success  100%</li>\n<li>Family Relationships               90%</li>\n<li>Health &amp; Wellness\n<ul>\n<li>Eat Healthier 37%</li>\n<li>Exercise More 41%</li>\n<li>Reduce Stress 26%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Family Stability\n<ul>\n<li>Improve Finances 74%</li>\n<li>Stabilize Housing 22%</li>\n<li>Improve Transport. 15%</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->"

Now at only 26, Base Culture has grown tremendously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Base Culture? From Paleo-friendly sandwich bread to almond butter brownies, Base Culture is a food company providing a wide, and delicious, array of Paleo baked goods.  With a sweet tooth nearly as strong as her dead lift, Jordann Windschauer is changing baked goods from a primal perspective. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordann Windschauer is not your typical chef, nor had she ever imagined her business would be in food. This former event planner found foodie-inspiration in her fitness routine. With the intent of getting to know the people in her crossfit gym, Jordann participated in a 30-day paleo eating challenge. For those unfamiliar with the paleo way of eating, the paleo lifestyle is free of grains, refined sugars and focuses heavily on nuts, seeds and proteins such as eggs. <img data-attachment-id=\"461\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/all-about-that-base-with-base-culture/base-culture/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=370%2C247\" data-orig-size=\"370,247\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gabe Windschauer&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1365436481&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 2013 Gabe Windschauer&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"base-culture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=370%2C247\" class=\"alignright wp-image-461 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Orlando food entrepreneur Base Culture\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?w=370 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new found paleo diet made a positive impact on her overall health, however, Jordann admits, “I missed baked goods and snacks as there weren’t any products available in the grocery store that followed the paleo diet.” So Jordann went about baking and creating paleo delights for herself, and very soon, her crossfit friends began putting in their orders.</span></p>\n<h2>From Kitchen to Market</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does someone go from selling desserts out of her own kitchen to selling them inside of major food retailers including Whole Foods? Jordann like many of us, took her message to social media. “I created a Facebook page for Base Culture to take and organize orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook was a testing ground for Jordann to see just how well her products would fair. “At this time, I worked my 8am – 5pm job as an event planner, I would work out from 5:30pm &#8211; 6:30pm and then would bake until the orders were completed.” And let’s not forget weekends, during which time, Jordann spent her time packaging and delivering products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Essentially working, and working out all hours of the day, Jordann continued this routine to perfect her recipes and find her audience. Not unlike many entrepreneurs, Jordann also worked a full-time job while simultaneously trying to get Base Culture up and running.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Testing her market via facebook sales and other on-line sales, Jordann could see that her desserts met a very particular food niche. She saw the need and set out with the intention of creating more paleo approved products and recipes suited for her paleo community. It took seemingly little time for the word of mouth to spread and soon much of the greater Tampa community began placing their orders on Jordann’s facebook page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Base Culture continued to grow organically and Jordann took the necessary business steps along the way to keep up. Today Jordann has a team of 11 people supporting Base Culture and her. “We have gotten over 100 stores nationwide to carry the products. Base Culture is also sold at all Whole Foods stores in Florida as well as nationally on Amazon. Additionally, we are expanding our presence in the food service world with our national contract with Sodexo.”</span></p>\n<h2>Winning With a Never Give Up Attitude</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with such early stage success, Jordann has learned to remain flexible, “One second a wonderful opportunity can present itself, and the next it could be taken away. Nothing is guaranteed, so learning how to have the hopefulness of an optimist and the clarity of a pessimist was very important.” For instance, Base Culture is striving to keep up with the great demand, but when they are unable to produce the amount of products that the stores want to purchase,  deals are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, Jordann decided to build a new facility that would support this desired volume.  “We are currently building a manufacturing plant that is 44,000 square feet.

Now at only 26, Base Culture has grown tremendously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Base Culture? From Paleo-friendly sandwich bread to almond butter brownies, Base Culture is a food company providing a wide, and delicious, array of Paleo baked goods.  With a sweet tooth nearly as strong as her dead lift, Jordann Windschauer is changing baked goods from a primal perspective. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordann Windschauer is not your typical chef, nor had she ever imagined her business would be in food. This former event planner found foodie-inspiration in her fitness routine. With the intent of getting to know the people in her crossfit gym, Jordann participated in a 30-day paleo eating challenge. For those unfamiliar with the paleo way of eating, the paleo lifestyle is free of grains, refined sugars and focuses heavily on nuts, seeds and proteins such as eggs. <img data-attachment-id=\"461\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/all-about-that-base-with-base-culture/base-culture/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=370%2C247\" data-orig-size=\"370,247\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Gabe Windschauer&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1365436481&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 2013 Gabe Windschauer&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"base-culture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?fit=370%2C247\" class=\"alignright wp-image-461 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Orlando food entrepreneur Base Culture\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture.jpg?w=370 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new found paleo diet made a positive impact on her overall health, however, Jordann admits, “I missed baked goods and snacks as there weren’t any products available in the grocery store that followed the paleo diet.” So Jordann went about baking and creating paleo delights for herself, and very soon, her crossfit friends began putting in their orders.</span></p>\n<h2>From Kitchen to Market</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how does someone go from selling desserts out of her own kitchen to selling them inside of major food retailers including Whole Foods? Jordann like many of us, took her message to social media. “I created a Facebook page for Base Culture to take and organize orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook was a testing ground for Jordann to see just how well her products would fair. “At this time, I worked my 8am – 5pm job as an event planner, I would work out from 5:30pm &#8211; 6:30pm and then would bake until the orders were completed.” And let’s not forget weekends, during which time, Jordann spent her time packaging and delivering products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Essentially working, and working out all hours of the day, Jordann continued this routine to perfect her recipes and find her audience. Not unlike many entrepreneurs, Jordann also worked a full-time job while simultaneously trying to get Base Culture up and running.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Testing her market via facebook sales and other on-line sales, Jordann could see that her desserts met a very particular food niche. She saw the need and set out with the intention of creating more paleo approved products and recipes suited for her paleo community. It took seemingly little time for the word of mouth to spread and soon much of the greater Tampa community began placing their orders on Jordann’s facebook page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Base Culture continued to grow organically and Jordann took the necessary business steps along the way to keep up. Today Jordann has a team of 11 people supporting Base Culture and her. “We have gotten over 100 stores nationwide to carry the products. Base Culture is also sold at all Whole Foods stores in Florida as well as nationally on Amazon. Additionally, we are expanding our presence in the food service world with our national contract with Sodexo.”</span></p>\n<h2>Winning With a Never Give Up Attitude</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with such early stage success, Jordann has learned to remain flexible, “One second a wonderful opportunity can present itself, and the next it could be taken away. Nothing is guaranteed, so learning how to have the hopefulness of an optimist and the clarity of a pessimist was very important.” For instance, Base Culture is striving to keep up with the great demand, but when they are unable to produce the amount of products that the stores want to purchase,  deals are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, Jordann decided to build a new facility that would support this desired volume.  “We are currently building a manufacturing plant that is 44,000 square feet. This will eliminate the challenge of mass production completely,” says Jordann. An accomplishment Jordann says she is most proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yes it’s costly, The saying is true, everything is more expensive than first anticipated.”  Knowing this, Base Culture has made it a priority to attain the certification needs that their customers are looking for. “Nothing about this venture is cheap. “Know what your goals are, develop a plan on how to reach them, and don’t let anything get in your way,” advises Jordann when it comes to expenses. “Know that it will be costly and financially prepare yourself for those hurdles before you reach them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img data-attachment-id=\"459\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/all-about-that-base-with-base-culture/base-culture-pumpkin-bread/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture-pumpkin-bread.jpg?fit=280%2C210\" data-orig-size=\"280,210\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"base-culture-pumpkin-bread\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture-pumpkin-bread.jpg?fit=280%2C210\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture-pumpkin-bread.jpg?fit=280%2C210\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-459 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/base-culture-pumpkin-bread.jpg?resize=280%2C210\" alt=\"Orlando food entrepreneur Base Culture\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Jordann credits her work ethic and sense  of entrepreneurism to her father and inspiration who has walked side-by-side with her along her journey, “The most valuable information he has ever given me was that the road will be rocky and you will experience the highest highs and lowest lows every day, but you simply cannot give up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showing no signs of giving up or slowing down, Jordann shares the future vision of her company. “Base Culture was born as an All Natural, Gluten Free, Paleo bakery in Tampa, Florida 4 years ago.

    "description": "<div><div>My husband and I had a great day yesterday. He's a surfer so we got up early and spent a few hours at New Smyrna Beach in the morning. I wasn't quite ready to go back to Orlando and give up on the beautiful day yet, so I suggested we drive north to St. Augustine to see how they were faring a few weeks after Hurricane Matthew.</div><div>Other than some lingering debris and a few waterfront hotels and homes still boarded up, on the surface everything looked great. I guess you don't get to be<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida\">America's Oldest City</a>by being weak and slow to rebound. Anyway, we've been to St. Augustine a couple of times, and took a stroll down St. George Street to take everything in. Kids in Halloween costumes were running up and down the pedestrian street, having a great time. We decided to stop into an old favorite, The Columbia, for an early dinner. I'm more of a fan of finding new places to eat, but Don loves the Columbia, and I couldn't say no to him. Plus I was STARVING.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_2c538cd432ea41bb99b09f1bcf881b99~mv2.jpg\"/><div>So we sat down in the familiar restaurant and I ordered a Sangria (I wasn't the one who was going to drive the 2 hours back home). We like our quiet, Sunday Fundays. So different from how we chose to spend Sundays a few years ago, now we enjoy one or two quality drinks, a great meal, and chat about the week ahead. I like growing up. I took my first sip of Sangria as soon as the waiter set it in front of me, and it was pretty good. Brandy...good. Red Wine, probably Spanish...good. Fruit...good. Then I noticed a little box next to the salt &amp; pepper shakers. SANGRIA MIX. What?!?! I go to this amazing restaurant and they try to sell you a MIX for the Sangria?  What could there possibly be for you to mix that you could get in a box? Oh, silly me...of course the main ingredients of any good sangria are dehydrated fruit mix, sugar, dextrin, tricalcium phosphate, fractionated coconut oil (what is that?), egg whites, red 40, blue 1, yellow 5 and yellow 6. Are you kidding me? No. Just no. Even the most recipe-challenged person can figure out how to make a tasty beverage without a bunch of weird dehydrated crap.</div><div>Here's my recipe...it makes a lot.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbad83_9f1052a1b04149a6a745be2833050f08~mv2_d_1800_3200_s_2.jpg\"/><div>1 box red wine...yes, I said BOX. You can also use a JUG if you want to get swanky. Why do I use cheap wine? Because I'm adding brandy, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm not going to notice quality wine, and frankly, I'd be wasting a good bottle. Feel free to find a cheap ORGANIC bottle or box if you must.</div><div>1 cup brandy</div><div>Club Soda</div><div>3 oranges, sliced</div><div>1 fuji apple</div><div>1 sliced peach or nectarine</div><div>1 cup pitted and smushed cherries</div><div>1 sliced lime</div><div>1 sliced lemon</div><div>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</div><div>1/4 teaspoon cardamom</div><div>Warm the brandy a bit on the stove and mix in the cinnamon and cardamom so they dissolve better. You CAN add sugar if you want at this step, but it's not something I'm a fan of. If you need more sweet to this sangria, add some raw organic honey at this step.</div><div>Mix the Brandy with the red wine. Squeeze the oranges a bit and drop them in the mix along with the rest of the fruit. Stir well and let sit at least a couple hours...overnight is better. Splash in a bit of club soda just before you serve. You can also use ginger ale or Sprite, but I'm trying to keep some chemicals out.</div><div>Enjoy this for your next grown-up Sangria Sunday. It will make Monday feel that much further away.</div></div>",

Some look at the food business from a whole different mindset. Orlando based Matt Ryan is just such a culinarian. Ryan took his culinary skills in a new direction and utilizing his strong business and branding skills, he began Uncle Matty’s Food Company. Uncle Matty’s Food Company currently produces a line of sauces that are “revolutionizing flavors one palate at a time” but the future of Uncle Matty’s will go beyond sauces.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan has much to be proud of, as he humbly admits, “We have been extremely fortunate to secure major retailers such as Publix, Winn-Dixie and Lucky’s Market while also advancing our avenues related more to the food side.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, success doesn’t happen overnight. “There are no shortcuts in building a brand,” Ryan said. When it comes to branding and making people aware of your particular concept, Ryan pointed out, “Orlando still has some work [to do] to catch up with other cities regarding its network infrastructure and the perception of local business.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So while the city of Orlando is playing a bit of catch-up, Uncle Matty’s is growing slowly, yet steadily. “Unfortunately, it’s never fast enough, but every startup must realize the landscape is full of bankrupt companies that rolled the dice expanding too quickly,” Ryan shared. “It is a tough business and requires nearly double the work one initially estimates. Like many businesses these days, the margins are small so multiple streams of revenue are critical.”</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">GOING MOBILE</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matt Ryan surrounds himself with mentors that keep him both grounded and focused on his business. So what does the future of Uncle Matty’s Food Company look like? It would seem that Ryan seeks to join the ever-growing food truck business trend. What better way to promote Uncle Matty’s Signature Red Sauce or Mustard Sauce, than on the foods they’re meant to complement. And while a food truck can certainly be less costly than a brick and mortar restaurant, there are still those unexpected costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan tells us he is unaware of many startups whose budgets were even close to being precise, especially when resources are limited. “There are so many moving parts it is nearly impossible for them to function flawlessly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I have done much of the work on the truck myself in an attempt to save money. When you are dealing with heavy equipment and large and varying quantities of retail products, the cost is often hard to accurately wrap your hands around.”<img data-attachment-id=\"417\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/food-trucks-foodpreneurs/uncle-matty1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=1242%2C1242\" data-orig-size=\"1242,1242\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Uncle Matty1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024\" class=\"alignright wp-image-417 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"Uncle Matty1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?w=1242 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If the cost of getting started were not enough of a challenge, there are many other business aspects to consider when starting a food business in Central Florida.

Some look at the food business from a whole different mindset. Orlando based Matt Ryan is just such a culinarian. Ryan took his culinary skills in a new direction and utilizing his strong business and branding skills, he began Uncle Matty’s Food Company. Uncle Matty’s Food Company currently produces a line of sauces that are “revolutionizing flavors one palate at a time” but the future of Uncle Matty’s will go beyond sauces.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan has much to be proud of, as he humbly admits, “We have been extremely fortunate to secure major retailers such as Publix, Winn-Dixie and Lucky’s Market while also advancing our avenues related more to the food side.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, success doesn’t happen overnight. “There are no shortcuts in building a brand,” Ryan said. When it comes to branding and making people aware of your particular concept, Ryan pointed out, “Orlando still has some work [to do] to catch up with other cities regarding its network infrastructure and the perception of local business.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So while the city of Orlando is playing a bit of catch-up, Uncle Matty’s is growing slowly, yet steadily. “Unfortunately, it’s never fast enough, but every startup must realize the landscape is full of bankrupt companies that rolled the dice expanding too quickly,” Ryan shared. “It is a tough business and requires nearly double the work one initially estimates. Like many businesses these days, the margins are small so multiple streams of revenue are critical.”</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">GOING MOBILE</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matt Ryan surrounds himself with mentors that keep him both grounded and focused on his business. So what does the future of Uncle Matty’s Food Company look like? It would seem that Ryan seeks to join the ever-growing food truck business trend. What better way to promote Uncle Matty’s Signature Red Sauce or Mustard Sauce, than on the foods they’re meant to complement. And while a food truck can certainly be less costly than a brick and mortar restaurant, there are still those unexpected costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan tells us he is unaware of many startups whose budgets were even close to being precise, especially when resources are limited. “There are so many moving parts it is nearly impossible for them to function flawlessly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I have done much of the work on the truck myself in an attempt to save money. When you are dealing with heavy equipment and large and varying quantities of retail products, the cost is often hard to accurately wrap your hands around.”<img data-attachment-id=\"417\" data-permalink=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/food-trucks-foodpreneurs/uncle-matty1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=1242%2C1242\" data-orig-size=\"1242,1242\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Uncle Matty1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=300%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024\" class=\"alignright wp-image-417 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"Uncle Matty1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=600%2C600 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ORLfoodlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Uncle-Matty1.jpg?w=1242 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If the cost of getting started were not enough of a challenge, there are many other business aspects to consider when starting a food business in Central Florida.

This award-winning chef began his professional career in some of the southern region’s most critically acclaimed restaurants including The Abbey in Atlanta, The Lark and the Dove in Roswell, Georgia and the Atlanta Athletic Club.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8197\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 192px;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Foodpreneur-Greg-Richie.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-8197 \" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Foodpreneur-Greg-Richie-e1469125701529-150x150.jpg?resize=192%2C192\" alt=\"Chef Greg Richie\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chef Greg Richie</p>\n</div>\n<p>Richie is a graduate of the Johnson and Wales University in Charleston, South Carolina where he received much of his culinary education. Upon completion at the University, he worked under the direction of Roy Yamaguchi at the original Roy’s Restaurant in Hawaii before being selected as Chef and Partner in the Roy’s Orlando location. Not long after, Richie was given the opportunity to take over the kitchen of Emeril Lagasse’s Tchouop Chop restaurant located at Universal Orlando’s Royal Pacific Resort.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 12\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Like other successful chefs, Richie also had the desire to open a restaurant of his own. “Soco has long been a restaurant that I wanted to develop and see come to fruition.” says Richie regarding the contemporary Southern inspired restaurant he opened in Thornton Park in 2014. “Back when I was with Roy’s, I was already working on the concept, but with a different working title. It was in 2007 that the name [Soco] came to me.” Soco is the culmination of Richie’s own Southern heritage combined with the various cooking styles he’d picked up over the years.</p>\n<h3>Southern Contemporary (or Soco)</h3>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-8198\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/foodpreneurs-Baoery-2750-e1469122861180-300x261.jpg?resize=245%2C213\" alt=\"foodpreneurs-Baoery-2750\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Soco has remained true to its concept—Southern Contemporary — while servers dressed in blue jeans have helped to create a decidedly relaxed atmosphere.

Upon completion at the University, he worked under the direction of Roy Yamaguchi at the original Roy’s Restaurant in Hawaii before being selected as Chef and Partner in the Roy’s Orlando location. Not long after, Richie was given the opportunity to take over the kitchen of Emeril Lagasse’s Tchouop Chop restaurant located at Universal Orlando’s Royal Pacific Resort.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 12\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Like other successful chefs, Richie also had the desire to open a restaurant of his own. “Soco has long been a restaurant that I wanted to develop and see come to fruition.” says Richie regarding the contemporary Southern inspired restaurant he opened in Thornton Park in 2014. “Back when I was with Roy’s, I was already working on the concept, but with a different working title. It was in 2007 that the name [Soco] came to me.” Soco is the culmination of Richie’s own Southern heritage combined with the various cooking styles he’d picked up over the years.</p>\n<h3>Southern Contemporary (or Soco)</h3>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-8198\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/foodpreneurs-Baoery-2750-e1469122861180-300x261.jpg?resize=245%2C213\" alt=\"foodpreneurs-Baoery-2750\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Soco has remained true to its concept—Southern Contemporary — while servers dressed in blue jeans have helped to create a decidedly relaxed atmosphere. Perhaps it’s for these reasons (aside from the delicious food) that Soco has found its success in Orlando. When asked what surprised him most opening a restaurant in Orlando, Richie says there’s no doubt it’s the people he has met along the way. “I am continually surprised and impressed by the people who live here in Orlando.

    "description": "<p>Former basketball player and U.S. Senator Bill Bradley once said, “Leadership is unlocking people’s potential to become better.” So true. You could also say the same about a community. While leadership is certainly not the only ingredient in a community becoming better, it is easily the most important. And it is surprisingly undervalued. That may because the type of leadership we often see, particularly in struggling communities, is authoritarian and self-serving – the opposite of what Senator Bradley extolled. And so people grow suspicious of the very idea of leadership and learn to distrust the leaders that they follow – often by default. This persists even when the efforts of these leaders do not result in improvements or the unlocking of potential.</p>\n<p>Polis Institute is adding a certification course in Growth Leadership to our training lineup in order to meet the need for more effective, other-focused community leadership. I am very excited about the pilot class that is being facilitated by Dr. Bahiyyah Maroon in Eatonville, Florida. Last night was the second of six classes in the series that will conclude on September 26<sup>th</sup>. The sense that potential was being unlocked before our eyes was palpable as the group shared positive stories of people living out moral principles &#8211; such as integrity, respect, and kindness &#8211; that are the foundation of the training. Early next year the program will be available to others who want to apply valuable leadership skills in their communities.</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

      "#": "<p>Former basketball player and U.S. Senator Bill Bradley once said, “Leadership is unlocking people’s potential to become better.” So true. You could also say the same about a community. While leadership is certainly not the only ingredient in a community becoming better, it is easily the most important. And it is surprisingly undervalued. That may because the type of leadership we often see, particularly in struggling communities, is authoritarian and self-serving – the opposite of what Senator Bradley extolled. And so people grow suspicious of the very idea of leadership and learn to distrust the leaders that they follow – often by default. This persists even when the efforts of these leaders do not result in improvements or the unlocking of potential.</p>\n<p>Polis Institute is adding a certification course in Growth Leadership to our training lineup in order to meet the need for more effective, other-focused community leadership. I am very excited about the pilot class that is being facilitated by Dr. Bahiyyah Maroon in Eatonville, Florida. Last night was the second of six classes in the series that will conclude on September 26<sup>th</sup>. The sense that potential was being unlocked before our eyes was palpable as the group shared positive stories of people living out moral principles &#8211; such as integrity, respect, and kindness &#8211; that are the foundation of the training. Early next year the program will be available to others who want to apply valuable leadership skills in their communities.</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->"

I have heard nothing but stellar reviews about the The Rusty Spoon and wholeheartedly agree with each raving fan. I’ve read all about the location of the restaurant in the Church Street District, the simple rustic, yet elegant style of the interior, and of course, all about the delicious food. Everything from a butcher’s plate made at the whim of the chef and a Caesar salad, to a “Dirty South” consisting of Canaveral shrimp, local catch and little neck clams in a rich shrimp-peanut broth, and of course, every tasty bite in between.</p>\n<h3>The Road to the Rusty Spoon</h3>\n<p>I feel like I know all about The Rusty Spoon, from its food to its layout, I know everything except for all of the effort it took for Kathleen Blake to bring the restaurant to life and the many challenges she has had to overcome.</p>\n<p>This Iowa native certainly has the chops to compete among the world’s greatest chefs, earning three James Beard Award nominations (2013, 2015, 2016) and seven Silver Spoon Awards. After working at several prestigious restaurants across the country, always with a focus on quality ingredients, Kathleen began her Orlando food career by accepting the role as Chef de Cuisine of Melissa Kelly’s Primo at Orlando’s JW Marriott Grande Lakes.</p>\n<p>It was during her time at Primo that she began her partnerships with many of Florida’s local farmers, including the beloved Lake Meadows Naturals and, with the help of her husband, William Blake, built and maintained an organic garden at Primo Orlando.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Kathleen’s entrepreneurial spirit emerged, and she, along with her husband and business partner, opened The Rusty Spoon. When asked why she wanted to open her own restaurant, Kathleen said, “We decided it was time to do our own thing and showcase some of the best ingredients in the place we call home – Central Florida.”</p>\n<p>Opening a restaurant isn’t all cooking and eating; there’s a great deal of business know-how required. “The biggest surprise was the cost of real estate. Orlando is much higher [in cost] than other major cities,” she said. “Then there are those unexpected costs no one plans for, unraveling business partnerships and impact fees, to name a few. Then there is the challenge of staffing and the changing foot pattern downtown.”</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rusty_Spoon_Food_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-7503\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rusty_Spoon_Food_2.jpg?resize=250%2C220\" alt=\"Rusty_Spoon_Food_2\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Keeping It Simple</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite these challenges, The Rusty Spoon prides itself on “Keeping it simple with the most AHHHHHmazing ingredients!” and has just celebrated its 5th year in Downtown Orlando. This is just one of Blake’s most meaningful accomplishments, in addition to raising four healthy, independent and accomplished children. When asked who has inspired her most, she replies, “My family and the incredibly resilient people I’ve met throughout the years as a chef. The stories I could tell!” Certainly many of us would love to hear those stories.</p>\n<p>Just as she has found inspiration in others, many foodies and entrepreneurs are inspired by Kathleen. When asked what advice she has for other ‘foodpreneurs’ wanting to start a profitable business, she responds, “The best advice is make sure you have a good attorney, be persistent, dream BIG and always remember, ‘if you build it…they will come.’”</p>\n<p>Kathleen has certainly built her business without compromising the things she values including local, fresh, quality food (not to mention tasty, too!). In return, the Orlando community, and people from around the world, celebrate Kathleen and her accomplishments as a true Orlando foodpreneur.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Forlando-foodpreneur-rusty-spoon%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/orlando-foodpreneur-rusty-spoon/\">Orlando Foodpreneur of The Rusty Spoon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>",

Then there is the challenge of staffing and the changing foot pattern downtown.”</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rusty_Spoon_Food_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-7503\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.i4biz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rusty_Spoon_Food_2.jpg?resize=250%2C220\" alt=\"Rusty_Spoon_Food_2\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Keeping It Simple</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite these challenges, The Rusty Spoon prides itself on “Keeping it simple with the most AHHHHHmazing ingredients!” and has just celebrated its 5th year in Downtown Orlando. This is just one of Blake’s most meaningful accomplishments, in addition to raising four healthy, independent and accomplished children. When asked who has inspired her most, she replies, “My family and the incredibly resilient people I’ve met throughout the years as a chef. The stories I could tell!” Certainly many of us would love to hear those stories.</p>\n<p>Just as she has found inspiration in others, many foodies and entrepreneurs are inspired by Kathleen. When asked what advice she has for other ‘foodpreneurs’ wanting to start a profitable business, she responds, “The best advice is make sure you have a good attorney, be persistent, dream BIG and always remember, ‘if you build it…they will come.’”</p>\n<p>Kathleen has certainly built her business without compromising the things she values including local, fresh, quality food (not to mention tasty, too!). In return, the Orlando community, and people from around the world, celebrate Kathleen and her accomplishments as a true Orlando foodpreneur.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ORLfoodlab.org%2Forlando-foodpreneur-rusty-spoon%2F&#038;via=ORLFoodLab\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org/orlando-foodpreneur-rusty-spoon/\">Orlando Foodpreneur of The Rusty Spoon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ORLfoodlab.org\">Orlando Food Lab</a>.</p>"

In some situations the goal of the church becomes getting more followers of Jesus, by way of getting more people into their programs. All the effort of Church staff and members is directed toward that goal: how do we attract and drive more people into more programs. While I understand the internal logic of that approach, I fear that sometimes the method becomes the message and the great Church of God becomes merely another brand.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything inherently wrong with brand identity, but when our relationship to the church becomes perpetuating a set programs that effectively recruit people to our brand, something really great gets lost.</p>\n<p>There ought to be great freedom when we encounter Jesus, open-ended possibility and gradual or radical transformation; but not constraint. There are lots of ways churches can be constraining. But one way that often goes undetected is constraining us all to the goal of world domination. Churches don&#8217;t need to take over the world, Jesus already did that. Our goal ought to be authentically living under his reign as much as we can. Churches ought to be the place where we&#8217;re encouraged toward and reminded of that goal; not busied with activities to perpetuate brands.</p>\n<p>When Zacchaeus met Jesus, he transformed from a thief to a philanthropist. When Saul met Jesus, he turned from a persecutor to an evangelist. When Lydia encountered the Gospel in Paul&#8217;s preaching, she kept selling cloth. Paul specifically taught people not to leave their jobs and become recruiters, but to stay in their stations of life and live them well. As we move toward a new gathering spot and start a new season of life together, one of my prayers is that the Cross will always be a safe place where you encounter the Gospel and then are sent out to live creatively, passionately, purposefully under the reign of Jesus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/822/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/822/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=15184355&#038;post=822&#038;subd=tcandk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

    "title": "Using Art to Visualize Community Assets",
    "description": "<p>Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD) involves leveraging what a community has to offer so that it can move itself towards a desired future. A first step in the process is typically some kind of inventory of what is there &#8211; talents of individuals, programs and facilities, informal groups, property &#8211; the whole nine yards. This information is captured, analyzed, and visualized so that connections can be made and initiatives can be created that benefit the community. The product of this inventory is often called an asset map.</p>\n<p>Art is a great way to visualize these assets and can serve as a nice complement to the more common options of a tabular list or a map. The most useful asset maps include all three &#8211; artwork, a database, and on dynamic online map. All three can depict the same information but are just displayed in different formats, each with its own appeal. The tabular data gives you just the facts, the map shows you where assets are, and artwork provides emotional and narrative content.</p>\n<p>This video describes an art project that POLIS led as part of the LIFT Orlando project:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVwKv-1mASg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The project described in the video above was fairly complex. POLIS was contracted by <a href=\"http://www.liftorlando.org/artproject\">LIFT Orlando</a> to do the asset mapping project and hired <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ArtWorks-Orlando-133851913300064/?fref=ts\">ArtWorks</a> to do the creative process with the children. There was a lot of planning to conduct the sessions in four different locations that included a school and three community centers. There were expenses to pay and significant expertise from the ArtWorks staff to guide the students through the process. But the end result was amazing. The art from the kids was inspirational and aligned very closely with what over 1,500 adults had said in door-to-door surveys.</p>\n<p>The survey information was entered into a database which was also loaded into a GIS (Geographic Information System).

A first step in the process is typically some kind of inventory of what is there &#8211; talents of individuals, programs and facilities, informal groups, property &#8211; the whole nine yards. This information is captured, analyzed, and visualized so that connections can be made and initiatives can be created that benefit the community. The product of this inventory is often called an asset map.</p>\n<p>Art is a great way to visualize these assets and can serve as a nice complement to the more common options of a tabular list or a map. The most useful asset maps include all three &#8211; artwork, a database, and on dynamic online map. All three can depict the same information but are just displayed in different formats, each with its own appeal. The tabular data gives you just the facts, the map shows you where assets are, and artwork provides emotional and narrative content.</p>\n<p>This video describes an art project that POLIS led as part of the LIFT Orlando project:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVwKv-1mASg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The project described in the video above was fairly complex. POLIS was contracted by <a href=\"http://www.liftorlando.org/artproject\">LIFT Orlando</a> to do the asset mapping project and hired <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ArtWorks-Orlando-133851913300064/?fref=ts\">ArtWorks</a> to do the creative process with the children. There was a lot of planning to conduct the sessions in four different locations that included a school and three community centers. There were expenses to pay and significant expertise from the ArtWorks staff to guide the students through the process. But the end result was amazing. The art from the kids was inspirational and aligned very closely with what over 1,500 adults had said in door-to-door surveys.</p>\n<p>The survey information was entered into a database which was also loaded into a GIS (Geographic Information System). But the information was also visualized in a more artistic way, or at least a graphic way. This involved loading the responses into an online word cloud generator called <a href=\"http://worditout.com/\">WordItOut</a> (there are several) that produced a graphic of all of the recorded words of responses to the survey questions.

I like that.</p>\n<p>I can think of lot&#8217;s of places I&#8217;d like to go with the people I love: high snowy mountains, secluded ravines, beautiful beaches or ancient churches. But as I walk through those questions, I always see myself coming back.</p>\n<p>There are friends and acquaintances here that wouldn&#8217;t make my travel list, but I&#8217;d still miss. I like the idea that I&#8217;m working with people all over Orlando to build something. On the kickball fields of the Jackson Center to the upstairs offices of the East End Market, from the West lake community meetings to the tech association meet ups to the office spaces above Park Avenue friends are doing their part. Cities are not living really, but sort of. They grow and mature, they develop personality and character. Cities have major arteries with hearts that distribute power and people and culture as lifeblood. They are the creation of people: designed and built, welded and paved, planted and uprooted, planned and governed, raised and released. It takes all sorts of people to make a great city, but they are the product of people. Through and through. I like that.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to the Great Creator, we create.</p>\n<p>Orlando is a great city for many reasons, but one is: there&#8217;s room for you. Don&#8217;t let fear of insignificance, or apathy for the future, or a myopic focus on it&#8217;s shortcomings keep you from the thrill of joining the collaborative effort. Contribute. The Cross is a good place to start. Many of us are already entrenched. We&#8217;ve built the alliances and are hard at work. Creation is best done with friends.</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=15184355&#038;post=787&#038;subd=tcandk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />",

I like that.</p>\n<p>I can think of lot&#8217;s of places I&#8217;d like to go with the people I love: high snowy mountains, secluded ravines, beautiful beaches or ancient churches. But as I walk through those questions, I always see myself coming back.</p>\n<p>There are friends and acquaintances here that wouldn&#8217;t make my travel list, but I&#8217;d still miss. I like the idea that I&#8217;m working with people all over Orlando to build something. On the kickball fields of the Jackson Center to the upstairs offices of the East End Market, from the West lake community meetings to the tech association meet ups to the office spaces above Park Avenue friends are doing their part. Cities are not living really, but sort of. They grow and mature, they develop personality and character. Cities have major arteries with hearts that distribute power and people and culture as lifeblood. They are the creation of people: designed and built, welded and paved, planted and uprooted, planned and governed, raised and released. It takes all sorts of people to make a great city, but they are the product of people. Through and through. I like that.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to the Great Creator, we create.</p>\n<p>Orlando is a great city for many reasons, but one is: there&#8217;s room for you. Don&#8217;t let fear of insignificance, or apathy for the future, or a myopic focus on it&#8217;s shortcomings keep you from the thrill of joining the collaborative effort. Contribute. The Cross is a good place to start. Many of us are already entrenched. We&#8217;ve built the alliances and are hard at work. Creation is best done with friends.</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=15184355&#038;post=787&#038;subd=tcandk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />"

    "description": "<p>Door-to-door community surveys are commonplace, especially in low income areas. I recently heard a long-term resident of such a neighborhood say, &#8220;We&#8217;re like rats in a cage here. People always studying us, trying to fix us.&#8221; Universities, non-profits, community groups, government officials &#8211; everyone wants to know &#8220;What should we do to help people in this community?&#8221; A common response to that question is, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s first find out what people need.&#8221; This often prompts the commissioning of a needs-based survey that catalogs and prioritizes these needs. The results serve as supporting evidence for raising funds and as a baseline against which progress can be measured over time.</p>\n<p>Asset-based approaches stem from a desire to know &#8220;What do people in the community care about enough to act on themselves?&#8221; And, &#8220;What resources are already present in the community to make a start.&#8221;  These types of surveys yield ideas, reveal trusted groups and leaders, and expose the talents and interests of residents. The survey process is used as a catalyst for conversation and the foundation of community-led initiatives.</p>\n<p>The differences between these two approaches, and the types of surveys that result, go far beyond the mere &#8216;glass half-full/glass half-empty&#8217; perspective. They are actually two different glasses used for two different purposes and having two different primary financial beneficiaries. The purpose of the needs-based &#8216;glass&#8217; is to provide services to a community while the purpose of the asset-based &#8216;glass&#8217; is to engage community interests and skills. The needs-based glass is designed to primarily benefit service providers financially while the asset-based glass should primarily benefits residents financially. Both approaches involve needs and assets and both can be viewed from &#8216;half-full/half-empty&#8217; perspectives. The difference is in who owns the glass &#8211; service providers or residents &#8211; and what&#8217;s in the glass &#8211; talents of service providers or talents of residents.</p>\n<p>For entities outside of a community that want to help, following an asset-based approach means doing things <em>with </em>the community rather than <em>for </em>the community. It requires emphasizing and utilizing what the community has to offer over what it lacks. And it is is distinguished by the types of initiatives that result &#8211; who is involved, what the goals are, who leads, how they are sustained, and who benefits financially. Greater community involvement results in more sustainable initiatives and greater community impact over the long term. If you want to empower a community to chart its own path forward, needs based services will never get you there. It is simply a different &#8216;glass&#8217; altogether than the asset-based glass.</p>\n<p>The table below contrasts some of the key differences between asset and needs-based surveys:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 285px;\" width=\"584\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\"><strong>Needs-Based Surveys</strong></td>\n<td width=\"276\"><strong>Asset-Based Surveys</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Focus on learning <em>about </em>the needs of a community so that services can be provided <em>for </em>them or goods can be given <em>to </em>them.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Focus on learning <em>from </em>a community so that initiatives can be built <em>by </em>the community and <em>with </em>the community.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Pose an extensive list of closed-ended questions to a minimum representative sample of a community.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Pose a short list of open-ended questions to as many people in the community as possible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Yield problems for which a service provider can provide solutions and programs.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Yield ideas most likely to directly engage the community in addressing their hopes and concerns.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Constrains community-wide vision of the future.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Unlocks community-wide vision of the future.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->",

The difference is in who owns the glass &#8211; service providers or residents &#8211; and what&#8217;s in the glass &#8211; talents of service providers or talents of residents.</p>\n<p>For entities outside of a community that want to help, following an asset-based approach means doing things <em>with </em>the community rather than <em>for </em>the community. It requires emphasizing and utilizing what the community has to offer over what it lacks. And it is is distinguished by the types of initiatives that result &#8211; who is involved, what the goals are, who leads, how they are sustained, and who benefits financially. Greater community involvement results in more sustainable initiatives and greater community impact over the long term. If you want to empower a community to chart its own path forward, needs based services will never get you there. It is simply a different &#8216;glass&#8217; altogether than the asset-based glass.</p>\n<p>The table below contrasts some of the key differences between asset and needs-based surveys:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 285px;\" width=\"584\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\"><strong>Needs-Based Surveys</strong></td>\n<td width=\"276\"><strong>Asset-Based Surveys</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Focus on learning <em>about </em>the needs of a community so that services can be provided <em>for </em>them or goods can be given <em>to </em>them.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Focus on learning <em>from </em>a community so that initiatives can be built <em>by </em>the community and <em>with </em>the community.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Pose an extensive list of closed-ended questions to a minimum representative sample of a community.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Pose a short list of open-ended questions to as many people in the community as possible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Yield problems for which a service provider can provide solutions and programs.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Yield ideas most likely to directly engage the community in addressing their hopes and concerns.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"294\">Constrains community-wide vision of the future.</td>\n<td width=\"276\">Unlocks community-wide vision of the future.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<!-- NgfbSharing::get_buttons content filter skipped: buttons not allowed in rss feeds -->"
