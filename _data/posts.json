It’s mentioned a lot, but is still worth considering: the “respectable” people came to Jesus only under the cover of night or in extreme crises if at all. It was the working class; the poor and marginalized who were most comfortable around Jesus. He made everybody else uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>When you picture Jesus’ people today, where are they? Where do they live, work, spend time? Where does his movement break out these days?</p>\n<p>I was reminded in conversation with a friend the other day that I want the way of Jesus to be the defining narrative of my life. More than my natural political leanings, or theological upbringing, or even the narrative of my childhood. These mindsets can blind us to Jesus in our midst, they did for folks in his day. I want the reality of his resurrection and authority to be the driving truth for who I am in the world: my opinions and actions.</p>\n<p>I’m working to give myself some space this week to consider where Jesus would be found these days so that I can begin to imagine how I might be found there as well.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/938/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/938/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=938&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"Light for the World","pubDate":"2016-06-13 21:15:58","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2016/06/13/light-for-the-world/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=893","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"I don’t know why he waits.

As we make choices to follow, we get joy and peace, which is an encouragement to follow more, trust more, hope more.</p>\n<p>The other day I loaded up money on my Sunrail card rather than buy the monthly pass. I’m experimenting to see which way is the best value for me. As I got on the train I was tempted to board with out “tapping” my card. If the conductor doesn’t ask for your ticket then no one knows you got a free ride. It’s an easy thing to do and happens often. It would save me money. As I considered it this thought entered my mind, “does God need you to steal $3 in order to get you what you need?” Oh, of course not. I tapped my card, paid for my ride. It’s a small thing, but the longer I live the more I realize that the Way of our God starts with small things. The decision to pay for my Sunrail ride is an opportunity to trust God and trusting God never disappoints.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/888/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/888/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=888&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"world domination.","pubDate":"2016-05-05 19:36:11","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2016/05/05/world-domination/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=822","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"I had an interesting conversation earlier this week where I found myself explaining how sometimes I feel like church culture in America has reduced evangelism to spiritual recruitment.

In some situations the goal of the church becomes getting more followers of Jesus, by way of getting more people into their programs. All the effort of Church staff and members is directed toward that goal: how do we attract and drive more people into more programs. While I understand the internal logic of that approach, I fear that sometimes the method becomes the message and the great Church of God becomes merely another brand.</p>\n<p>I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with brand identity, but when our relationship to the church becomes perpetuating a set programs that effectively recruit people to our brand, something really great gets lost.</p>\n<p>There ought to be great freedom when we encounter Jesus, open-ended possibility and gradual or radical transformation; but not constraint. There are lots of ways churches can be constraining. But one way that often goes undetected is constraining us all to the goal of world domination. Churches don’t need to take over the world, Jesus already did that. Our goal ought to be authentically living under his reign as much as we can. Churches ought to be the place where we’re encouraged toward and reminded of that goal; not busied with activities to perpetuate brands.</p>\n<p>When Zacchaeus met Jesus, he transformed from a thief to a philanthropist. When Saul met Jesus, he turned from a persecutor to an evangelist. When Lydia encountered the Gospel in Paul’s preaching, she kept selling cloth. Paul specifically taught people not to leave their jobs and become recruiters, but to stay in their stations of life and live them well. As we move toward a new gathering spot and start a new season of life together, one of my prayers is that the Cross will always be a safe place where you encounter the Gospel and then are sent out to live creatively, passionately, purposefully under the reign of Jesus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/822/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/822/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=822&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"open doors.","pubDate":"2016-03-24 18:09:17","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/open-doors/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=792","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"I once had a professor tell me that the most powerful point in the story of Christianity is the empty tomb.

I understand what he meant. There is so much possibility there. The road away from that stone can go almost anywhere. Christ, walking around in the world with a glorified body means we’re no longer bound to our basest instincts. God can raise us to the heights of our best desires. We have a future somewhere out ahead of us that is unambiguously good.</p>\n<p>But if I had to isolate the most powerful point in Christianity’s story, I would pick a different spot: the Garden of Gethsemane on the night Christ was betrayed. It feels like the fulcrum on which the future of humanity is leveraged. In that moment Christ decides not only his next course of action but the depth of his confidence in the goodness of God. Hanging on the outcome of that decision is the manner of his death, the scope of his life and the future of mortality. It turns out the faith of Christ is deep enough to swallow humiliation, injustice and death. As he kneels, alone in the garden that overlooks the ancient City of God, that point is decided.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow is Good Friday. I love that day. Not because Christ died. I love that he chose death. I love that confidence in the goodness of God drove him to believe God’s promise more than the visceral reality that confronted him.</p>\n<p>His belief opens the door for me to believe. On Good Friday, he throws the door wide open.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/792/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/792/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=792&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"build it.","pubDate":"2016-02-25 20:21:51","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/787/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=787","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"where would you go if you could?

I like the idea that I’m working with people all over Orlando to build something. On the kickball fields of the Jackson Center to the upstairs offices of the East End Market, from the West lake community meetings to the tech association meet ups to the office spaces above Park Avenue friends are doing their part. Cities are not living really, but sort of. They grow and mature, they develop personality and character. Cities have major arteries with hearts that distribute power and people and culture as lifeblood. They are the creation of people: designed and built, welded and paved, planted and uprooted, planned and governed, raised and released. It takes all sorts of people to make a great city, but they are the product of people. Through and through. I like that.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to the Great Creator, we create.</p>\n<p>Orlando is a great city for many reasons, but one is: there’s room for you. Don’t let fear of insignificance, or apathy for the future, or a myopic focus on it’s shortcomings keep you from the thrill of joining the collaborative effort. Contribute. The Cross is a good place to start. Many of us are already entrenched. We’ve built the alliances and are hard at work. Creation is best done with friends.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/787/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=787&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"who before what","pubDate":"2016-01-08 14:50:18","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/who-before-what/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=756","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"I had a conversation with a friend the other day.

Not unusual, but still it’s worth mentioning: have conversations with friends folks.</p>\n<p>This one started with him saying, “It seems like you’ve really found ‘your thing’ I wanna find my thing.” He had some post it’s in front of him and an intense brain storming air about him. He was mentioning about how some major life events had already happened, implying he had just made his way through life up til this point, but now he was ready to find his thing. This thing would be the large answer to angst and finances and boredom and purpose all wrapped into one. But he seemed a little clueless. I mean, not completely, he knew some things he liked doing or was good at but he really didn’t see how they coalesced into the great solution.</p>\n<p>Several years ago I read this story about Jesus. He’d just heard that his cousin had been beheaded. He got in a boat and went to the far side of a big lake to be by himself. Understandably, he wanted to be alone. But, folks heard he would give out free healings. So they tracked him. When he got to the shore a crowd was waiting for him. It was exactly the thing he was trying to get away from. But when he saw them “he had compassion on them and healed their sick.” Maybe it’s because I’m introverted, but that blew my mind.</p>\n<p>When I realized that Jesus wasn’t just doing a job, something clicked. His concern was genuine not obligatory. He healed because he loved. His job grew from his identity. Instead of looking for one great solution to the question, “what ought I to do?” Jesus’ makes it possible for us to consider the deeper question: “who would I like to be?” That question is rarely answered with one great solution; it comes with small choices.</p>\n<p>This year I’ll be asking myself that question again: who do I want to be? then I’ll be looking for small ways to be it.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/756/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/756/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=756&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"Jesus’ compilation","pubDate":"2015-09-14 14:29:21","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/jesus-compilation/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=750","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"In his most famous compilation of messages, Jesus tells his hearers that they are the light of the world and the salt of the earth.

They are what gives the world flavor and reveals the reality of things. Part of what inspired me toward a life of service to the church is the realization that she is the tribe of people who, in every generation and every nation, empowered by the dynamic Spirit of God make the world better. Having been brought to life they flavor the world around them.</p>\n<p>The Cross Orlando is a continuation of that tradition. In our ranks are the people doing the things that make the City better. We’re raising kids with heart and passion, we’re starting companies we believe in, we’re inspiring others to do the things they love, we’re creating space for friendships and celebrating beauty.</p>\n<p>In one day last week one of our own hosted a Yelp Orlando Made workshop, another celebrated one year running a business of dinner parties, another shared the story of their art on the Tedx stage.</p>\n<p>The best way to the life you were made for is to live it around people being brought to life by the Spirit of God. Here’s hoping you can find your way there.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/750/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/750/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=750&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]},{"title":"","pubDate":"2015-08-21 14:49:32","link":"https://tcandk.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/745/","guid":"http://tcandk.wordpress.com/?p=745","author":"Ben","thumbnail":"","description":"Some time ago I settled, with conviction, on the notion that life is better with Jesus than without him.

I suppose that’s implied in most of our approaches to Christianity, but pulling that truth out of the shadows of implicit motivation and into the light of explicit assertion made all the difference for me.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple truth. Yet it had drifted so completely into the background of my faith that it was practically forgotten. The action it was supposed to be motivating had become paramount: action for it’s own sake. Following Jesus was only about duty; merely work whose best reward was being right, and being right was getting old. Christianity doesn’t work very well that way.</p>\n<p>When I stumbled again on that original notion, it felt like a new realization. Slowly it began to change my approach to living. What’s the most holistic evangelistic approach in light of that notion? What evangelistic approaches cheapen or undersell my motivation and belittle the offer? If Jesus intends to make my life better, not merely right, what expectations does he put on me? What is not asked of me?</p>\n<p>The conviction that life with Jesus is actually better than life without him, has affected how I approach most things. Evangelism has moved away from marketing and tactics that imply people need to be sold. Christian duty has moved away from spiritual recruitment that implies Jesus saved me merely to save others. My chief task becomes believing the Gospel in ways that act on its truths: walking through life as though I’m not guilty, taking opportunities as though the God of the universe was on my side, earning money as though God can manage my responsibilities better that I can, befriending folks for fun as opposed to need or agenda.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tcandk.wordpress.com/745/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tcandk.wordpress.com/745/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tcandk.wordpress.com&amp;blog=15184355&amp;post=745&amp;subd=tcandk&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n","enclosure":{"link":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22d4f96c82bccc0429885a8e793b6d4c?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"},"categories":["Uncategorized"]}]}
