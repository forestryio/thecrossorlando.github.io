- name: Ben
  bio: "I grew up in the church, was baptized as a baby and have been learning to live with the Lord ever since. I met and married Megan while attending University of Florida. Together we moved to St. Louis while I attended Concorida seminary. We now have three beautiful kids and live in the SoDo area. We founded The Cross Orlando with a few friends in the fall of 2010. For us it's been a lesson in the generosity of God, the fact that he's drawn such a unique group of people together into a congregation that fits us so well feels like an extreme demonstration of his kindness. I'm proud to pastor such a great family and always hope to be able to authentically say, with St.Paul, follow me as I follow Christ."

  bio: "I was privledged enough to be raised up in a family of faith, but after doing life on my own terms for too long, I questioned God and turned away until I had everything fall apart and expose the desperate truth that I still needed my Savior and not my agenda. My wife, Tiffany and I moved from Orlando to Portland, OR in 2012 where we committed to a small church and invested for the first time in a community of faith and where we were invested in as well. This dramatically impacted our lives and our marriage and we knew that community was the center piece and watched it become an invaluable part of our walk. Since then, I had not sensed that type of church community until I attended The Cross for the first time and told my wife I could see moving back for this church. After living in the Northwest and on the road for 4 years, we moved back to Orlando after the opportunity to be a lead part of the community and Discipleship at The Cross opened up, I had no question that God had had this in the books for some time and I believe there is something truly unique here and that God is very timely and vibrant and people are taking noticing here. I am honored, privileged, and hopeful to serve, pray, and lead in the community at The Cross and be involved in the lives of the folks who have come to call it their home and their family."

- name: Carole
  bio: "Growing up with a sweet relationship with the Lord, I don't remember a time without Him.  My family is full of generations of faithfulness and I'm proud to carry that legacy into my own family.  In 2004 I graduated from Bethany College of Missions in Minneapolis to pursue a career in ministry.  Since then, the Lord brought me a North Carolina native husband Mike and two kids, Moses and Elie.  Our family has taken a fabulous journey from a home in Raleigh, North Carolina to three years in Minnesota for Mike to finish his degree in Graphic Design and then finally to a wonderful home here in Orlando.  We love our community at The Cross and enjoy watching our kids participate in a place that loves and cares for them.  I find joy in teaching the children what it looks like to have faith in a God that we cannot see and to pass the stories of our people from Scripture on to them is something that can never be replaced.  I am excited to see how their lives unfold with this sweet relationship that I see growing inside each of them."

- name: Phil Hissom
  bio: "I believe that Christ Jesus is the hope of the world. I love seeing him bring hope and harmony to discordant lives and communities and am so very grateful that he has done so time and again in my own life. I also believe that his Church is the primary steward of his story and that The Cross plays an important role in the story of Orlando. Jennie and I moved here in 2005 after our first three years of marriage to attend seminary and decided to stay when we graduated. We have been involved with The Cross in some capacity since the beginning and are now blessed to attend regularly with our foster children whom we love dearly."

- name: Sarah Rosario
  bio: "I spent most of my growing up years in Orlando, never imagining a life here as an adult. My parents brought me up in the faith and I feel thankful to see Christ as a constant in my life's story. I started coming to The Cross in 2012. I had moved back home to go to grad school for speech-language pathology and was reluctantly getting used to the idea of being in Orlando again. I first decided to attend because it seemed like a peaceful place to be reminded of the gospel every week. Friendships developed, I met my husband Eliel, and we found ourselves with a growing commitment to The Cross community and its place in our city.  I'm so grateful that, despite myself, God would direct my path back to Orlando and allow us to build a life here alongside such a great church family."

- name: Michael
  bio: "Or 'Moose' to a few. I serve at the Cross and lead us in song when we gather together. Years ago a friend invited me to the Cross, and the following Sunday I helped with the music. After a few months of helping out, I was invited to lead the music and have been ever since. In the community of folks at the Cross, I have found my closest friends. It's where I met my wife. It's where I was asked to be a godparent. The Cross is my family, in the most real sense of the word. Of course there's a lot more to my story and I'd love to share it with anyone who wants to hear it. But I'd love even more to do that in person. If you'd like to know, please ask me. But for now, let me just say thank God for His grace and thank God for my mother!"
